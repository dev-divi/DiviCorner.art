My soul has for some time been reaching the point of desiring not to have desires -   
my single desire is for the one Presence. 

All areas of existence point towards it, hover around it. 

If I think about it,
I've found people are bad translators. 

When people say,  
*"desirelessness is contentment"*

*"rid yourself of desires, then you will be fulfilled"*

They make it sound confusing.  

When you are contented, you are not wanting.   

Stop wanting, and you can rest in contentment.  

If you want to stop wanting, you are going to have to seek out a practice that involves that,     
and optimally you will want a practice that has a rate of success,    
which means not looking for the "cutting edge" brand new technique that will break tomorrow,  
but identifying the tried and true.
