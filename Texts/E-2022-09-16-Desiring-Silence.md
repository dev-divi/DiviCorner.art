There is a reason we look for what is between duality.  
There is a purpose to this philosophy.  
Between being and non-being  
Silence and sound  
Darkness and Light.  

This is a place the mind cannot go,  
and with this realization,  

The Being might awaken.

There is no beauty like when a human heart opens to you to reveal a love and fire inside of it.  
I have come to a place where I no longer want to speak out loud to anyone.  

To speak of beauty is to destroy it   
To hold it is to hold it in silence   
By speaking I might move away from it.
