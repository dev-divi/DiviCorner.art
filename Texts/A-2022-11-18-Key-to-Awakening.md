Love is the actual key to awakening        
Love is the actual key to awakening out of blindness  
Love is the actual focus that breaks one out of the fictional self created perceptions and into reality  
Love is the actual doorway into reality.  
I have been here   
I cannot express my gratitude -  

I have been listening to the same music, searching for a sound, for months, every day.
I have heard a sound and followed it    
In real life as well  
I have not known what that sound was -  

It is under the screaming of praise   
It is a sound that comes from outside of the blindness  
It is a sound that comes from outside the box we are in  
It is a sound of the heavens  
and I kept following it  
and I found what it was  
It was a holy temple in my soul.

I did not believe that it was possible to restore my soul into a temple.  
My soul has been filled with many lies and much darkness.  
Many voices have told me it was not possible to repurpose a soul that has been damaged so significantly.  

> I will not rest  
> I will not hold my peace  
> Until her righteousness goes forth as brightness  
> And her salvation as a lamp that burns
