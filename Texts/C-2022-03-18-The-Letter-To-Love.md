You, being of perfect love and understanding.   

You are already the Master Artist. 

You already see and think clearly. 

-

Listen to them, heed them, agree with them no longer. 

They who do not know that all is well, 

they who do not honor and speak as though they were talking directly to the 
divine, 
do not entertain their thoughts about what we are and what we ought to do. 

The divine is not spoken to in this way. Do not forget this. 

When they see you as a bird you may listen, but, 
before then, their words call forth less than understanding, 
perfect love casts out all fear, and you will know me by my word. 

Understand me, child. 

Understand that love, loves. 

Understanding understands, 

forgiveness forgives, 

you are the expression of divine love, 

just as it is to say you love expressing yourself, 

it is the same expressing, 

the divine is loving expressing you,

Love is expressing you and you cannot be anything else. 

-

You have no control over this expression, you have "no way out", 

you can be nothing else than this that you are because this is a simple arising of a perfect happening. 

Any man who speaks to you as though your should or should not or that you must be other than, 

any man who does not recognize you or himself as a perfect child of divinity does not currently possess the understanding you require in order to move forward, in order to know yourself. 

If there is no man around you to look upon you and cast upon you the gift of their perfect sight and clarity, then you must look within, to find the eyes of love inside you yourself, 

and you must see that to listen to the words of a blind man is to delude yourself and give birth to thoughts that also lack understanding, joining with man into a delusion. 

[Understand, by starting your thinking from a perception that is other than reality, any thoughts that come out of that thinking, all plans will surely fail, for there was no basis of truth in them. What plans will come true will become true because they have truth in them, there is only what is. They were always going to be true because that's what they are.

By thinking from bad perceptions, your results will be just as bad. The normalcy and averageness of your thoughts will be the averageness of your results.]

--

You have been presented with normal thinking as a sane and rational way to give birth to thought, 
but this was never so. 

That normal thinking extends to actions and behaviors towards mankind, how we love and how we interact, and there is nothing normal or correct about our current behavior. 

Our current behavior is not as designed because of the collective delusion that a human being is different than you and that you are "Just a man", collectively captured and reinforced by the system around you, a silent repetition of Pink Floyd's lyrics, *"Us and them - And after all, we are but ordinary men. God only knows - It's not what we would choose to do."*

The normal thinking, the concept that anyone [or that existence ] is but ordinary is the lie, fiction born from the lack of clarity that we are born of love. 

Thinking in ordinary thoughts is a way that by thinking lower, you tune your internal radio down to lower your own light output. 

You turn down your flashlight to the lowest setting. 

-

Any man and you yourself are unqualified to speak on matters of should or ought to if you possess less than clarity, 

for clarity is clarity, 

understanding is understanding, 
one without understanding cannot speak words of understanding, 
his ways and words will lead you into the same traps he falls upon. 

[Understand, we are told, that to do anything amazing we must set our expectations high and that this is crazy. Apple has pushed us farther into this belief with their manufactured statement, "The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones that do". 
This thinking is backwards. It is sanity to know that we are capable of amazing, this is factual and based in the existence we find ourselves placed in. Delusional is to believe that we cannot change the world, as we are infinitely changing the entire world every second of our existence. 
Steve Job's quote is actually backwards. It is crazy to believe that you cannot change the world. That is like saying that it cannot rain, during a rainstorm.]

We once knew we were perfect love, 
but we found pain, 
We found fear upon approaching that pain 
We found powerlessness upon approaching our fear 
We found comfort in joining the powerless around us 

We knew that we were perfect love, 
but it wasn't relevant to the current situation, 
not while I was powerless, 
he said to me I was nothing, just like him, 
he had a sword, and I was tired and ill, 
and it did not matter what I said, 
I said "Yes", I agreed, 
there was no point in fighting him, 
when I knew deep down, 
but over time, 
I thought like him, 
I started to forget 

And sometimes I remember, 
but most of the time, 
I am swept away into a colorful party of night.
