I was reading of Jesus talking to the Samaritan woman by the well of Jacob and I've glimpsed an entirely different possibility of world events, 

I feel that the Samaritan woman he meets on the road is of his own kind, that he speaks with her not because he is increasing his sphere of influence, but that he is talking to her woke person to woke person, 
And saying words that she is at a level at which she should be able to understand, 

"If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink" 

I see a two part conditional statement,
1. If you know the gift 
2. Who it is who speaks to you 

As being words this woman can someday understand, and both conditional statements go together, one condition is dependent on the next, 

If you knew the gift of God IS love, 
And you know the gift, 
Then you would know you are the gift, we are of love, and you would know what the gift is, you would know the gift. 

And you would also know who it is who speaks to you, because who it is who speaks to you is the gift of God. 

In his second statement, 
"You would have asked him and he would have given you living water." 

I see this as interaction is as follows, 
1. Jesus and the woman sense each other are kindred spirits, 
2. Jesus makes the connection and wishes to see if she is awake as he thinks she might be, 
Asking her for a drink, 

If she is awake in love, if she knows the way of love, she will hand him the drink without question, love does not question. Love only serves. 

I think then the statement is actually intended to mean,  
- "had you known the gift of God, you would have asked to serve me, and I would have given you living water."
It seems the word serve is missing here. 
He asked for water, had she known love, she would have asked to serve him water. 

She does not give him the drink, which tells him everything he currently needs to know about her, she is not a servant of love. 

Being a servant of love was not a new concept, the fact that the imposed "serve" is missing and the meaning is lost, makes me feel that someone knew the concept of being a servant of love, and did not want that concept extrapolated from this conversation. 

This transaction would have honored the laws, 
Had she asked to serve him water, thereby giving him water, she would have received love, 
Because she had demonstrated an act of love that living water of love would have been returned to her. 

But she does not give him the drink, and I think in his answer, "and who it is that asks you for a drink", while confirming she did not return the exchange, he is not just telling her off but also probing her for one last opportunity to see if she can return the exchange.

She shortly later identifies him the Christ, and he fills that role. 

This has made me stumble onto a thought, 
Love fills whatever is needed and asked for, 

The world called and asked for the Christ, perfect love became what the world asked for. 
The world had heard words about love before but it was not listening for it or asking for it. 

Jesus' response to the woman in summary is a statement that stays in the context of conversation, explains a concept to her, and perfectly aligns with the spiritual law. As usual, the truth in his words are self-evident, in speaking truth by acknowledging what is, the principles that are, his words remain within truth and no amount of bad translation can destroy this. 

Here is a hidden spiritual principle within a secret exchange of a secret way that could not be edited out of the bible by the church because they could not even see that it was there. 

These words are a gift intended for the woman and intended for me, letting me know that there are these people out there and they have always been out there. It is in being misunderstood that makes us feel alone. It is in being understood that makes us feel that we are not alone. Thank you. 


*"Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.

The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)

Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”

The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. So where do you get that living water? 
Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his children and his livestock?”

Jesus answered her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”

The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I don’t get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw."*
