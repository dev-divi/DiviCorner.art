This writing process is invaluable to my life. There are days that strokes of great insight are found directly on the page,   
and other days like today in which little fruit is born on the page itself, but wherein wheels of cognition once rusted shut begin to turn on a dormant system in my brain, forced 
to spin on their own, like the starting ignition of the engine of the car or chainsaw.   

After a long duration of this practice I have been able to tap into access of the creative flow, 
a state that is felt by my entire perception of being, my entire world. There is no other state I would rather feel than the creative flow, and it can be accompanied by states of 
great presence, awareness, love, peace, and other states simultaneously. 

To me, creative flow feels like bathing in golden light, and feels infinitely connected to the real me, whereever he is.  

After this engine has started, it is often a few hours before I am struck by lightning, as an expanded awareness hits me and I am able to access advanced cognition, from which I can see 
possibilities and options and choices I did not have access to before. This process has been adapted by Julia Cameron's "The Artists Way".  

While my goal is '3 pages', there are days I face extreme resistance and no fruitful writing from writing that duration, the entire point of meditating on creative flow is destroyed by the act of trying to get the goal done. When this is the case, I often find myself checking other notifications and messages and destroy the process entirely.   

When this is the case, I now start a stopwatch instead of going for duration. This allows me to write without the pressure to perform, which is the entire point of the process. The pressure to perform is what prevents the access to creative flow. It is only when it is removed that it is accessible, that I can access it.   

I find the stopwatch more effective than the timer, but if I do not want to even risk pulling out my phone for a timer in case end up distracted, checking my messages, trying to get an early dopamine hit,  
then looking at a clock as a timer is more than sufficient. 

With the timer, I am able to meditate on my breath or presence while writing, which is usually when I can find myself experiencing the creative flow. I started writing only on the computer, telling myself that because I had a lot to write, I ought to write on the keyboard because I can write more and catch more thoughts. I was wrong about this belief. I gain far more clarity and insight through writing with ink on physical paper. I am able to get lost in the feeling of ink as well. Today I ran out of paper, so here I am writing on the site. I will likely take a piece of paper and write on it just to experience the somatic experience.  

As I have been on this practice for a year, I have started to realize that perhaps *I don't even need to actually transcribe words onto the page*, I can actually just move my pen while thinking and telling my brain that I am writing, and it believes me. I have also started to experiment with writing **only** the first letter of each word onto a page, but the amount of cognition it requires to think about the first letter currently takes more time than it does to just write out the word.

I recently reencountered an article that must have been where I first learned of The Artists Way, titled [Writing at the Stream of the Unconscious](https://www.creativitypost.com/create/writing_at_the_speed_of_the_unconscious). While I do not see a method here to write at the stream of unconscious, I am now wondering if I can create such a method. I will be experimenting with this.

# Start 

_What is this I am feeling as I am here without the physical paper, what should I do  
should I give up  
should I write in my mind?   
Is that possible? Is it possible for me to do my morning freewriting in my own head?  
To feel the letter upon the pen,   
and here is the access to the flow right straight in the morning not even doing anything   
Full connection   
Simple here    
Simple Presence    
And I'm clear    
I waited so long to feel this way    
and now I write for length of days    
To Be I am pleasantly in tune    
I continue vibing at my leisure, at the most critical of all times,    
"What did you do"    
I wrote    
And I kept writing    
As the world crashed around me    
I was solid    
I was secure    
I found something    
It opened up to me_   

_and how nice this is, to clarify    
but this time is for the free writing and the letting go and so I write and I pray and I say and I stop trying to make pretty words because that is not the reason for being here and I am just trying to let out whatever pours out without an audience without a doubt and perhaps you'll forgive me perhaps you'll let me out perhaps this is temporary perhaps this will pass and perhaps I can breath and perhaps I will not repeat a word or just relax into a keyboard stroke and how I'd like to what would you like to do you're doing it, between the feeling of flow in tapping keys and the feeling of flow in moving ink what exactly is the difference because to me it is the same it is the same way we went ahead and discoursed and discussed and happened to walk wantder into meaning and blessing and wondering too and it could take a while there could be 
a long way to go and I am still just tapping along and I don't have anywhere to go as long as I move forward and I had better rest as I type and focus on my breath and focus on these things that I enjoy in the moment whatever they were, can't remember and does it matter if I will remember again in a moment, the fear of silence is that I cannot remember, but if I do not fear forgetting, what have I to fear, after all, 
when I am being in stillness, I require no thought or remembering at all, and look at how that thought registers as terrifying, as a threat, and look at how instincts have arisen, and I'm still writing, not trying to figure it all out, I don't need to write clearly or write better or write this way or that we are just moving forward we are just moving the keys we are just doing the work moving forward in the practice and listening to the soft sound of the tapping of keys and your words are too stale your words are not and all the thoughts and all the ideas and all the thoughts and the words and the words and the words and so many things I could capture and catch and I suppose as I write I just become more clear, the more clear I am the more without beer the more and here and there into skies and there stretching the imagination for a tune 
and this is how I open my mind to the clarity and how its so worth it and that's interesting and how about that, and here I am eating wind and beating chest and breathing in and happening to be the best whether I want to or not I find myself in the prestine spot in my own life and there's really not a way out I have looked for the escape routes and so I am here in the eternal moment that carried me into meaning and I found the sacred flame,_

_And I do want to meditate more on the eternal flame, I will probably do that today_ 

_I have come so far_

_How about that!_

_And anyway we were just writing here by the side of a road and thinking about how difficult I found it to imagine good things in my mind, and how I have been told, it has been mentioned that it is actually better that I didn't imagine, that I should allow the divine mind to imagine for me and lead me into the perfect moment,    
if only my own fears and the darkest desires in my self destructive heart weren't arising too!    
Ah, we found that and we found meaning and we came to be    
Disrupted, why    
Was I supposed to stop,    ceef643179bef246cbbda34bd892a48b
You should stop writing shouldn't you you should be doing something else no?    
Why are you so boring? Why aren't you being interesting? Why do you keep saying the same thoughts over and over? Why aren't you expanded? Why do you not play? Why won't you do more    
Why won't you be better Why are you just being normal level And awoke and awake and how about the date_   

_how about the places we ran into when we came into being and we wanted to find meaning and I got    
lost in the thoughts and it happened just as it were and I came into the stir and I found my way into a burr and you said to keep writing so I did and you said I'd be okay and so far that was true but what about everyone else? What about, why? What if the divine plan isn't aligned with me? What if I'm not aligned with the divine plan? What if I'm not looking at the highest reality? I feel something shift upon this question in my heart, it hearts a bit, a clarity spikes, a meaning of strife, a violent's delight,_    

_ah, ah, stretching out again against the clutter, I was in the attic full of cobweb collecting dust and there is a way out of a door I just have to keep going,    
'just write a little more'   
just do a little more    
just perform    
why aren't you like them    
they can do so much and they can do it right and they can do it like they are supposed to and they can think    
and so and so and so and though and though and though and    
you are a master writer you know I know you can't see it but you made it to that level   
you made it to that level that you can now write anything you want    
it doesn't matter really what you write now    
you're basically free, free to be    
and the best writings and the worst they all accumulate_  

_and so close    
all I have to do is be a light, that's it, a voice of clarity, tough to admit?    
That's all it is, a voice of reason, a voice of treason! Ahahaha. It's alright.    
And god what I owe them, for offering compassion on my ego,    
for defending me in court_

_That really shines as a testament of humanity    
that they've defended me when I have been my worst enemy    
Protect me from me    
Defend me with glee_

_I feel a release and I don't know what moved but it was something special    
22 minutes in    
You're running out of time now,    
is there anything you wanted to say? Is there anyone who was wanting to speak?    
2 minutes, drawing to a close, about to end writing    
and here I am writing and I'm just writing now and I'm letting go and I'm so glad she blessed me and I'm so glad to learn I'm not alone and I'm so glad to witness that my breath is part of the larger breath and my life is between a song of life and that even if my story were tragedy this too shall pass, even if I was imprisoned, that I fear a great deal, even if all spoke against me, even if the matrix attacked me, even if they locked me up forever, someday it would end, someday I would see the light again, but I beg the lord for the highest destiny, the greatest life, thank you. I praise the lord for the highest destiny, which I'm experiencing right now! You know what I want now, as to why I'd want it who could know, because I see the possibility of it, because I already am it, because I want what I am already being, a teacher, in this current time. I have seen results and so I would like to go forward and there's only 4 minutes left out of time my eyes have watered my meaning has altered my perception has cleared and how I'd liike to take a walk 
it's too bad that it's saturday and all the locals are out but wow this one minute has slowed to a crawl still stuck in a moment of eternity so much time to fill in one minute imagine how could I waste a moment like this with all these minutes I could do so much couldn't I but here I am witnessing some persons life for reasons I not know why and I suppose it doesn't matter though I am greatly invested in the outcome being the one to inhabit this spot, and I consider releasing these pages, having been on this journey for a while now, however boring, whatever waste of time, don't waste anyone's time, don't waste anyone's time, don't waste my time, don't waste my life, don't do it, it's not alright, how dare you be doing this, how dare you think that it is okay to bring boring words to surface, to be a bore, how dare you not be more, how dare you under perform, but who am I to perform to? What delusion do you suffer? There's no olympics, there's no stage. We're drifting in a moment of eternity, what exactly did you think you were doing here? 
Are you a pep coach or a voice of torment? Where do you go when I'm not around?    
The last 60 seconds wasted quick    
breaths emit    
breaths out last   
breath of wind   
I have not the words for the      
water in air   
I breathe in    
The water in Air   
I Am the Water in Air    
I Am the Spirit of the Wind, I carry the water    
I Am a Water Bearer._
