The deeper I go into silence, the more weight I feel on speaking

I changed

I found myself as a being

And found that humanity is just a dress

And I'd like to write about it

But I haven't had so much time

I have 3 articles posted soon

My content is changing

Along with my direction

And intentions

And love

I require an identity that is not looking for validation or proving my words to others. 

This does not mean the surface level, "I don't care what you think",

It is a different game because it is not the old game. 

The old game was verifying to see if what was said was quite silly.

The new game is knowing what is real, and staying connected to what is real, 

and destroying what is false.

The element required is a trust and I will gain this trust.

It sounds like this is an intellectual decision but the reality is it is a decision to continue to move deeper into the love that is in my heart and put it above any other.

The wisdom of the heart says that there is no voice louder than silence

I'm going to be writing about how the flow state pertains to consciousness,

the future of this phenomenon, 

how we can bring flow into reality, 

and also about what I see as the ultimate meditation
