*"Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away. Behold, the new has come!"*   


When I thought of this verse, I was thinking more about a directional pulling away.

There is a verse I found in the book of Sirach, I believe this verse may be accidentally deep.

*"Do no evil, so will no evil overtake you. Depart from wrong, and it will turn away from you."*

Whatever you turn towards you are going towards. 

__*"In all you do, remember the end of your life, and then you will never sin."*__ - Sirach 7:31

-

Here we have a teaching I have heard from a mystic, 
That you should have your death at the forefront of your existence of all times in all your considerations.

In another sense you ought to have that level of wakefulness.

-

Another translation decides to interpret it as lower level knowledge as this, Whatever you do, remember that some day you must die. As long as you keep this in mind, you will never sin.

It would be better to say, -

Live this moment as if it was your last moment - 

Scan the environment you exist as -

Contemplate that this is actually the last moment, it will never happen again.

-

I contemplate if I behaved the way I was satisfied with dying as, 
'Did I find out?'

Bringing it back into context if we combine these two concepts - 

If you are pursuing your highest ideal until your death, 

And you are keeping at the forefront of your attention your death,

Then in all your life you will be refined towards that ideal and direction, 

and if there is any hope at all after death, surely you will keep going in the direction you were going.

Reality always reciprocates what you are going towards, and opens up greater dimensions that you were not aware of before in that direction. 

Surely there would be hope in this, 
For you don't want all of those things other than that highest reason. 

That highest reason is always a more authentic and real you, 
You want it because it represents you, and because you want to be you, yourself.

So look, as the old things are passing away, and the new creation is being birthed - 

I have been completely incapable of feeling wonderful 
But I have pursued that direction,
And wonderfulness has found me.
