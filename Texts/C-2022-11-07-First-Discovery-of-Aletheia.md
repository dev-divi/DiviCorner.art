Tonight I have stumbled upon the most important revelation of my life,  
the confirmation that Jesus was an awakened consciousness.  
That he saw what I see,  
and that he spoke of what's spoken of.  

As I always speak,  
that truth is reality,  
That man lives sleeping, that he isn't awake to reality.  

I have found that Jesus spoke of the same, but man mistranslated him.  

So going back, to me [retranslating the gospel of Matthew from my perspective of awakening](https://medium.com/@0xdivi/the-gospel-of-love-and-anarchy-483281cbc2a1), 
Then later wondering if I had been wrong in doing so,   
And now seeing that the actual translation is actually how I retranslated it naturally,   
Giving confirmation and validation to myself that my interpretation was not of an isolated delusion or deception,  
but that I have the ear to hear.  

First, I will show the first verse I saw when I opened the bible as someone was praying for me

> "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel:   
> Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you.   
>  

> For behold, days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will restore the fortunes of my people, 
Israel and Judah, says the Lord, and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers, 
and they shall take possession of it."

Next I was led to notice this verse,
> "I still have much to tell you, but you cannot yet bear to hear it.   
However, when the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all truth. For He will not speak on His own, but He will speak what He hears, and He will declare to you what is to come."
> ..  
> But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come."  

I noticed the "spirit of truth" did not say "the Holy Spirit" so I looked into it and this is what I found, 

> alétheia: truth  
Original Word: ἀλήθεια, ας, ἡ  
Part of Speech: Noun, Feminine   
Transliteration: alétheia  
Phonetic Spelling: (al-ay'-thi-a)  
Definition: truth  
Usage: truth, but not merely truth as spoken; truth of idea, reality, sincerity, truth in the moral sphere, divine truth revealed to man, straightforwardness.  

> HELPS Word-studies  
225 alḗtheia (from 227 /alēthḗs, "true to fact") – properly, truth (true to fact), reality.

> [In ancient Greek culture, 225 (alḗtheia) was synonymous for "reality" as the opposite of illusion, i.e. fact.]  

Alethia was synonymous for reality.  
This is just as that work I had created,  
and it shows that Jesus was awake,  
not this religious idea, he spoke of real things.

Reinterpret this, 

> "I still have much to tell you, but you cannot yet bear to hear it. 
However, when the Spirit of reality comes, He will guide you into all reality. For He will not speak on His own, but He will speak what He hears, and He will declare to you what is to come."
