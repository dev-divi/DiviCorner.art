This writing covers a spectrum of what we hold onto that makes us suffer, starting with how forgiveness works. 

There is a model of forgiveness that I have which is simple, but full disclosure of this model, we come from another dimension that exists only love, and Christ showed us that it was possible to access that, basically by establishing a relationship between man and divinity, showing that the possibility of man + divinity was possible. 

In less dogmatic terms, within that dimension of love, only that which is of that substance and nature can exist there, only that which is of love can exist there. Forgiveness, mercy, compassion, caring, tenderness, lightheartedness, these come from that place.     
Bitterness, resentment, hatred, they cannot exist in that place, if you tried to shove bitterness into that dimension it would not be able to push through, it is not possible for it to exist there. Because of this, when we access real forgiveness from love, it is forgiven, no matter what it is.   

We can say things are unforgivable in our minds and in this world, we may be unable to understand how it is possible that something could be deserving of forgiveness, 
but regardless of our understanding, it is possible for all things to be deserving of forgiveness because of the way that dimension works. Because when accessing love, it can't not be forgiven, because love can't exist with unforgiveness. The exposure to love destroys unforgiveness. It's like an alchemical reaction.   

Painting out this model is important for two reasons. The first is the good news, which means that it is possible for you to be forgiven, even for what you cannot forgive yourself for. This is the possibility of redemption, that redemption of man is a real possibility.   

The more practical relevant part of this model is **why** we ought to forgive. We understand that certain things are flat out *not okay*. It would not be okay for this man to repeat his infidelity and harm your ability to trust, and it would not be okay for you to go back to him and put yourself through those soulically damaging injuries, harming your ability to trust again, and decreasing your self-value until you gave up.   

I've painted out all of this for this possibility, it is that our forgiveness is not the giving of a gift to the people who hurt us. Forgiveness is not for them, it's for us. 
The reason we ought to forgive is not because we should be good people and they are deserving of forgiveness, we ought to forgive because we are deserving of being okay, because we do not need to suffer.    

Because love has forgiveness, unforgiveness cannot be love, and within spaces without light, both in our hearts and physically on our bodies, dark seeds grow in spaces without light. Resentments grow, bitterness grows, suffering grows. Because the physical body reflects the heart, the bitterness that grows in us will physically cause us to become ill and grow cancers and disorders and pains. The greater the suffering [and stresses] we hold on to, the more damaging it is to our bodies and minds.  
From another angle, if love is perfect, then unforgiveness is imperfect. We are meant to be perfection, and healthiness is in perfection. We are meant to be well and deserving of that wellness, it's essentially man's birthright.  

When we hold unforgiveness, we are holding something that doesn't belong to us. We are holding a toxic kryptonite that makes its holder suffer and that has nothing to do with us.   It is in our best interests to not carry unforgiveness and let go of ill intentions so that we can feel better and be okay, in the same way that holding onto the desire to punish someone hurts you over time.   

One of the most important reasons why we even have unforgiveness in the first place is because we are knowing and valuing that we have value and that something is wrong. Someone betraying your trust is more than just that, it's the harming of something sacred and of value, and there is a recognition that this should not be this way were someone seeing in fullness. It's actually a deeper knowing that if someone was really seeing you and how much you matter and are deserving of being treated well, they wouldn't possibly do such a thing to you. On the other end, knowing how much you matter, it hurts to know that you allowed what is sacred to get damaged,   
and this is a form of righteousness, the call to protect and honor what deserves protection, such as our heart, our trust, innocence. It is when these things that do not deserve to be hurt get hurt are we upset. 


A few additional notes from this conversation for clarification,  
- I am not attempting to break down these processes with logical arguments, I am describing processes as I understand them.  
- I mean that we are not meant to be sick in any way, that is not our perfection. If you introduce other than what is perfection, we become ill and/or suffer.  
- **I'm not saying in any way that we should forgive because we should in any moral way. I'm saying it is in our best interests to do so** 
- Forgiveness is something in the heart, not an action in the real world  
You aren't required to even tell them that you forgave them  
This doesn't mean behaviors or actions are okay or that we should put up with them, if you're putting yourself into the same situation to cause the offense again, you're causing an offense to you by not protecting and respecting you.  
It doesnt mean a person is justified, it doesn't mean we are required to understand them, it doesn't mean we have to accept them, it doesn't mean we have to put up with them. 
- Acceptance isn't required. But usually when you forgive someone you would see that they made these actions because they are suffering.

- If your focus is to be accepting of everyone, this will bless your life greatly, you bless everyone friend and enemy and all blessings return to you 
but that is an act of work that gives you rewards, accepting someone is not a requirement of forgiveness, of letting go of burdens that are not yours to carry.  
- As for *how* to forgive, it's not something we have the ability to do really, it's more like we have to acknowledge that we will let it go, ask for help for it to be let go, and allow it to happen  
and maybe even give it some space and attention and just let it be there for a bit, instead of trying to avoid it, or trying to rush it to go away.
