When we work, we have to learn and grow  

If we stop learning and growing  

It's like shoving your soul into metal saw grinder and forcing it in there  

You gotta game your time in the moment  

Get kindle audiobooks to listen to what you need to learn to study  

If you're on a laborous job and you have headphones  

Try listening to these Alan Watts playlists.

These are reuploads of the original creator's videos that were taken down  

When you turn on these videos, don't even worry about trying to listen to the speaker,   

just ignore it and enjoy the music,  

once he starts talking about something interesting as you're working and your mind picks it up,  

you will be mesmerized.

Plan and consider how you can find other methods to learn more and take more advantage of your time as well as moving into a position that gives you additional freedoms.
