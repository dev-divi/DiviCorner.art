Info: looking at an outdated version of The Book 1, I looked through the table of contents of the original, it's not the book i want to publish, 
not one page of it. 

now **the teaching book, the how to learn book, that might still have some value, 
especially when you consider that that's what had value to me in timothy ferris' book. **

so maybe Perspective Core + How to learn somewhere in the middle
