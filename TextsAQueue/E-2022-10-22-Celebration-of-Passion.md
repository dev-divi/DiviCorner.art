[1:58 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: There is so much passion in me right now
[1:58 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I don't have words to describe my thoughts
[1:59 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But in my life
[2:01 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I didn't agree with the world that I lived in
[2:01 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was wrong about a lot, but there were some things I understood.
[2:02 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: At this moment, I have the deja vu that I have written this same explanation in this server before, but this time with more clarity
[2:02 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: This time with this epiphany, if it were accurate
[2:03 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Is it possible that to be given divine revelation while still divine, then it is possible to hold on to the understanding?
[2:04 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: My mother taught me of the fruits of the spirit when I was a boy. 
I understood, these perfections were inside of me. 
I did not have to manufacture them. 
I was taught to hold on to these as sacred and keep them.
[2:06 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Then I grew older, and ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. I gained an awareness of more than my own good, I gained the awareness of evil, the mind of my fellow man. 
I learned that none of these people followed their own teachings, 
that man said one thing and did another.
[2:06 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was angry, alone, and unrepresented.
[2:07 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: There was no one who validated my thoughts.
[2:09 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I inherently knew what I wanted, and it was connection. I was deathly afraid of all things, deep fear was instilled in me even as a child. I wet the bed each night in fear of a world of vast complexity that was not safe.
[2:11 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I had eyes to see, and I saw interesting people, and I would engage them. I discovered that to do this, they would reveal a hidden world to me. For many, this was more than sacred, for I was the first person they had revealed their secrets to.
[2:11 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I had bad teachers, good teachers, and myself, but everyone and everything was my teacher.
[2:15 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I had access to compassion, I cared for others, and throughout my life I was able to operate in acts of courage, as a support in people's lives, and as a voice of reason. 
Yet, while I dramatically preached of my perspectives, I was afraid. 
I saw other men, they were cowardly, and yet as men they acted in boldness. 
What kind of man was I, who acted enthusiastically, and yet as a man I was a coward, afraid of pain?
[2:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: For a time, one part of me was afraid of any negative possibility being true about myself. I would encounter a negative person and be afraid that perhaps I might be like that as well. I was a hypochondriac of existence.
[2:22 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Many people were surprised to hear me explain that I had any fear at all, saying that they could not possibly see me in that way.
[2:24 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I remember a time when I had deep social anxiety, 
and went into an event with hipsters playing videogames, and I picked up the controller to play. 
A friend of mine was there. 
He was surprised to see me in that way, out of my element. 
He had never known me to have even a shred of anything but the egotistical confidence of my name. 
And yet, how many lifetimes I have lived with not a single shred of confidence.
[2:26 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Through my different aspects and stages and periods and phases, 
even losing my whole identity, and many states of disassociation, 
I still held on to that one understanding, of how it should be, how the world should be, 
even if I did not have the courage to express it.
[2:27 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Surely I knew hell, understanding how I should live but being unable to act within it.
[2:28 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: In fact, most of my struggle was on a different plane, between addictions and goals and desires.
[2:28 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But the scripture was true.
[2:29 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I had faith, planted as small as a mustard seed, and it was growing the whole time. I never lost that one crop.
[2:32 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I think that as I adjusted, as I began to cooperate with my world, 
as I gained the tools to learn how to become my own master, 
as I learned to become whole and real and one,
and someone and no one, 
that people assumed that I was compliant 
that I agreed with the world I cooperated with
[2:33 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But I have always been waiting until even a taste of power was in my hands to operate from
[2:33 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It's not the way I think I should be, it's the way I need to be in order to become me
[2:34 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It's not that I need to act as a force of good for a humanitarian reason, 
It's that I need to act as who I am in order to be me.
[2:34 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And me, is the most real part of me.
[2:35 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: The most real part of me, is what others derive value from, it is the loving part of me.
[2:35 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It is that which I and the world hold as valuable
[2:35 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And that which when I express it, I value witnessing it, and others value witnessing it.
[2:36 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It is the same that I wish for others to express it, and I am made just as happy when I witness them express it, as I am for me.
[2:37 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It is even my wish that the hardest people to like are able to be expressed like this, I have been confronted with their fatality, and seen the pricelessness of their life, even the worst of the worst and the most lost of the most lost are deserving of this.
[2:38 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I am writing all of this because I am celebrating and rejoicing.
[2:40 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I have lived long enough and gained just a taste of just enough power to operate out of the love I stand by, that is my way, 
and to see that people would love me for this, 
that they would say "love you" to me, a stranger, a foreigner, 
not in a "we love you way", but in an 'all the way' way, 
this is beyond compare.
[2:44 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: To see that, for me to choose myself, my heart, and take the risk to speak out for it, and even to make decisions and actions that will offend others, at great risk to myself, and to do it anyway, 
to not judge someone when everyone else would surely judge them in that moment, 
to not come against someone when they would surely be my enemy, 
to not condemn someone when they surely knew they were wrong, 
to put myself below, to speak vulnerably, 
to take myself from a high place and take actions that hurt my reputation, 
there are some acts of self sacrifice that we have choices to make that go beyond acts of goodness, they are which take on damage and suffering with no perceivable benefit, not because of results, not because of gain.
[2:47 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: On a daily basis, all it is, is looking at the world that is coming at me with an external pressure with a threat of repercussion if I do not act within the confines of normal behavior, 
and me willfully breaking that normal behavior through an act of which I am unsure of the consequences or results. 
In that moment I don't even have trust or hope, in that moment I am dreadfully afraid, 
but I consider that while I may not like the outcome, I can't control what happens, I could control the choice I made and I made a choice I am willing to stand by.
[2:47 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I don't know what others see
[2:48 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but I know that I am seen as a juggernaut
[2:48 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: and that to others, I act as though I have no regard for anything but being present for the moment
[2:49 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: and that I have good attitude in the midst of difficulty
[2:50 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: For me to be this person for people, it is priceless beyond compare. There is validation, confirmation, that the way I was walking with God was an accurate calculation of the data I had available, that my God is for me and not against me, and the reverse of this statement, that I am for and not against my God
[2:51 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It mattered to me a lot to be loving
[2:51 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was never able to be loving
[2:51 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was loved by many in the general sense, thanks to the compassion of others
[2:52 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but I was not able to reach out to love beyond the confines of my normal abodes
[2:52 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I keep thinking, my intuition says, 
That it is possible that I helped people's fear of abandonment issues.
[2:54 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was clearly going to leave these people. This place was too much. The darkness was too much. It was destroying me. It did destroy me for a while. It swallowed me. It hurt me. I wanted to turn and never look back. People asked me when I was going to quit.
[2:55 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Everyone could see I was done. And I did not agree with this story and I found the love I was looking for and I came back and my intuition says that they saw this and it meant a whole lot.
[2:55 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: My eyes water when I write that with a tinge of emotion, surely there is some truth in it.
[2:58 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: There is a knowing that there has been an impact with which I cannot see. I can see the impact I have made, but I know that there is a wider impact with those I could not see, those who were watching me.
[2:58 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And now, persona 5 has finished downloading, my eyes have finished watering. :prayge:
[2:58 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: :whiteTux: :feelsgreen:
[2:59 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: :PepeLove:
[2:59 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I love and I will always love and I will continue to love
[2:59 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: and this world will not stop my loving for it already happened and cannot be unwritten.
