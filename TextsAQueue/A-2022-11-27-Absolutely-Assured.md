[3:14 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: If desirelessness is wisdom
[3:20 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: If proverbs promises that if you follow wisdom, 
you will essentially be protected, 
to say it in rough terms, 'the universe will honor your trust' 
or to say, 'by exuding trust your universe will become trustworthy' 
or to say, 'if the result of wisdom is good fruit then the outcomes around you will be good if the target focus is on the pursuit of wisdom' 

or to say, 'the 'scientific method's' 'proof' of real wisdom will be a favorable outcome. 

To say another way, a fool will reap destruction, a wise man will reap blessings, 
a fool who thinks he is wise will still reap destruction, because he does not have the asset

[3:26 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: from a blog - 
*"Get wisdom: Before David gave him the actual words of wisdom, he first encouraged the pursuit of wisdom in Solomon. We might say that this is even more important than any particular piece of wisdom, or it is one of the early lessons of wisdom. Value wisdom, pursue wisdom, sacrifice for wisdom, get wisdom and understanding."*
[3:27 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: `"Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you;
Love her, and she will keep you.
Wisdom is the principal thing;
Therefore get wisdom.
And in all your getting, get understanding.
Exalt her, and she will promote you;
She will bring you honor, when you embrace her.
She will place on your head an ornament of grace;
A crown of glory she will deliver to you.”
[3:29 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Is it possible that David intuitively understood the importance of living life with a receptive heart, 
without actually having exposure to teachings regarding pointing the attention of one's life focus towards the soul, towards desirelessness? 

It seems David actually incidentally taught his son the principle that would lead him to wisdom's deepest secrets
[3:33 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It seems then, with my positioning in the matrix and access to information, absolutely an assured truth that 
having any exposure to the concept of wisdom from a young age 
introduces the possibility that one could begin the search for the information that life will give you, 

another way to say what I am saying is, 
It seems then, absolutely an assured truth that exposing a mind to the ancient scriptures, even if you build a religion around them, or even if you have bad teachings, you introduce the possibility that one could begin the search for real truth. 

Why is this the case? This is the case because all thought is directional. The holy scriptures are a direction of thought. 
This direction of thought already exists within you, a pathway waiting for you to reignite and travel upon. The pathway is there, you just have to send the electricity through your brain and activate it. 

To point the mind at itself
[3:38 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: As I write this, I am simultaneously being reminded of old thoughts from many years ago, asking questions, 
"Is there actually any point? I know there is no where to go. To pursue enlightenment is a joke, that's what idiots do, play mind games with themselves to trick themselves into a false perpetuated state of bliss so they can avoid dealing with their lives. The focus itself means you've already lost." 
At that point, there was only blindness with no evidence of any kind that there might be anything. 

Then deeper down the trail of wisdom, answers revealed more and more hopelessness. It's all futile, there is no point. 
Not only is there no point, but out of three possibilities, I've got a %66.6 chance of getting screwed.
[3:41 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: 1. God takes me straight to the heavens, 
a.k.a. the light of my spirit pulls me directly to the highest state of consciousness I attained upon nothing holding me down 
2. Upon death, my soul instantly latches on to the last desire it had, taking me infinitely towards the eternal hell of desires, like a moth to flame. The unthinking soul just can't resist. 
3. I used too much methodology, became a thief and a robber by trying to find an alternate route into the kingdom. By refusing to accept the simplicity of simple faith, it's eternal damnation in cold isolation for me.
[3:43 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: But now, resting in the level of awareness I am at, 
there is some hope. 
Life can be worth living.
In silence, I am discontent, restless, searching to avoid suffering, searching for dopamine, just like everyone else. 
I spend time wanting to be in silence because I understand that there can be no rest until there is rest. 
You cannot have contentment until you have contentedness.
[3:44 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Now, if the pursuit of meditation's result was a finite state of bliss, 
I would argue that while this would be a healthier alternative to many remedies, 
it just doesn't really fit where everyone is at all the time.
[3:45 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Now, if the pursuit of meditation's result was something more, 
its potential efficacy for mankind is a completely different paradigm shifting supernova of possibility.
[3:45 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Imagine this possibility
[3:45 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: You condition the mind to go into a patterned state
[3:46 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Into a direction that leads you towards an experience you hope for
[3:46 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: an experience you've imagined
[3:46 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: but you are floating in that direction
[3:46 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and then you are stopped by a wall
[3:46 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: the experience you hoped for was your own fantasy, your own imagination, that isn't real
[3:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: too bad
[3:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: but what is this wall?
[3:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: you've just hit upon something
[3:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: it's a door
[3:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: it's the door
[3:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: to you
[3:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and if you open that door
[3:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: you know
[3:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and you are
[3:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and you remember
[3:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and you are in the same perfection
[3:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: as that drummer I keep watching creating a perfect peace
[3:49 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: not only have you entered into the state at which you have gained your fulfillment
[3:49 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: but now others around you just want to be in your presence, they just want to be around you
[3:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: because when they spend time around you
[3:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: they gain that state too
[3:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: you're conditioning them
[3:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: simply by your presence
[3:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: to join into that presence
[3:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: that wavelength, that thought frequency, that mental pathway
[3:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: this possibility is good
[3:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: it's like being positive except it is more like being miraculous
[3:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: because this has miracle potential
[3:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: suddenly do not build your house upon shifting sand becomes the ultimate metaphor
[3:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: the ultimate metaphor to mean, do not build yourself on fragile, temporary, elusive, mental pathways, states, conditions of being
[3:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: build yourself on a rock that will not fall apart by the waves of the ocean
[3:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: or
[3:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: construct and chart out the mental pathway that will be accessible by all mental pathways
[3:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: by all states
[3:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: by all conditions
[3:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: when you have contentedness even when there is nothing to do
[3:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: when you have contentedness when there is no one there
[3:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: because someday no one is going to be there
[3:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and someday there will be nothing to do
[3:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and you will have either prepared for that time or you won't have
[3:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: the only way forward on this path is continually abandoning your brain's conceptions of "all", continually letting go of your mind's conclusions that it has it all figured out
[3:57 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: when you hit pure consciousness, there is no question, there is no faith in the matter, there is no consideration. 
It was always the way, it was always the purpose, it was always the meaning, it was always the point, it never changed, it will never changed, it is the way existence is.
[4:00 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: some men shout "there is a God" because they are little script repeaters with no cognition of their own
other men shout "there is a God!" because they do not know how else to express to you that there really is a Somethingness out there, 
and once you touch it, 
what you think doesn't matter, 
what others think doesn't matter, 
no concern of this world matters, 
Nothing matters in the face of that. 

They are shouting it to you because they know you either haven't seen it or have forgotten it. They know you don't know because your mind wants to argue against it.
[4:06 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: What is the means for constantly holding on to the thought ‘Who am I?’
When other thoughts arise, one should not pursue them, but should inquire: ‘To whom do they
arise?’ It does not matter how many thoughts arise. As each thought arises, one should inquire
with diligence, “To whom has this thought arisen?”. The answer that would emerge would be “To
me”. Thereupon if one inquires “Who am I?”, the mind will go back to its source; and the thought
that arose will become quiescent. With repeated practice in this manner, the mind will develop the
skill to stay in its source
[1:59 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I glimpsed a verse today, 
It said something like,
"I have left the one door open for you, because I know you were tired and did not have the strength to open it."
[2:07 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I have been looking for trust
[2:07 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I noticed in the "Who am I meditation" 
I experienced a potential trust
[2:08 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I reflected on this
[2:09 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It is possible that I was afraid of knowing who I am, 
And having a story or identity revealed which I did not agree with. 

But all feelings are connected to thoughts, and all stories are attached to thought
[2:11 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: In the "who am I meditation" it is possible that by knowing I was not going to attach "me" to any thoughts that were arising, 
I could trust the unknown. 
I could temporarily trust not knowing who I am,
perhaps because at least I would not be identified with these feeling thought forms.
[2:12 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It must be true that self inquiry is the key to becoming
[2:12 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: There is no person behind my thoughts
[2:13 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: But there is an all pervasive, unknown being behind my thoughts
[2:13 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Perhaps I can come to know
