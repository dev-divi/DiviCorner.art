[10:46 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I had a revelation last night, but the experience was not rested into
[10:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I was concentrating on the word "Worthy"
[10:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I visualized it
[10:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I set it as the only word in my mind
[10:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Then I was browsing YouTube simultaneously, found the guy who made the 10 hour Osho chillstep mix remade it, I turned it on again
[10:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I'm hearing the same lecture I've heard before
[10:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: He's saying, in my translation 
How the master has a sort of easiness about him
[10:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Not just effortlessness
[10:49 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: What is the word
[10:49 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And he goes, and here's this teaching, 
"If he feels like sleeping, he sleeps."
[10:49 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: "If he feels like eating, he eats."
[10:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: On the surface this is silly, he is a glutton
[10:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: But no, he is simply doing and being
[10:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: First he was doing that
[10:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Now he is doing this
[10:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: There is a softness about it
[10:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I will probably talk more about this
[10:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: But the revelation
[10:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I'm listening to this, again
[10:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And I finally understand the secret
[10:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: "If he feels like sleeping, he sleeps"
[10:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: "If he feels like eating, he eats"
[10:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: "If Divi feels like being worthy, he is being worthy"
[10:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: "If I feel like speaking, I speak"
[10:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It is almost to say
[10:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: That if the desire comes up
[10:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I will be with the desire
[10:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: If I feel like it
[10:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Or I won't
[10:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: If I don't feel like it
[10:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I don't know if this teaching is worth a dime
[10:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: But I will rest with it
[10:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And find out
[10:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And now I am being sad
[10:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And now I am being angry
[10:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And now I am being restless
[10:56 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And I am being sort of effortless about all of it
[10:56 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨:

[11:34 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Have I ever told you
[11:34 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: That I enjoy principles of which
[11:34 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Are self renewing
[11:34 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Principles that are sources upon sources
[11:34 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: As in
[11:35 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I don't want the fire that burns out
[11:35 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I want the fire that ignites a fire
[11:35 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I want the knife that self sharpens
[11:35 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The kerosene oil
[11:35 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Oh.. the oil
[11:35 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And the fire
[11:35 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And the water
[11:36 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I didn't realize the oil could go with fire
[11:36 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Have you ever felt oil
[11:36 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It is like a liquid coating of hot smoothness over your soul
[11:37 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Similar to the oil one rubs on skin
[11:37 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Fire until silence
[11:37 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And then it rains
[11:38 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Holy mass awakening
[11:38 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Did you know that this is not only possible but it is impossible for it to not happen
[11:39 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Death fades
[11:39 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Life pours out
[11:39 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: There's a taste
[11:40 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: You have nothing to lose
[11:40 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Comfortability will not last
[11:42 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It is better to be set ablaze
[11:43 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It is easier and you want easy
[11:43 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It is easier to let go and ignite an unraveling
[11:44 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Because everything you are holding onto, 
All of your judgements, 
Your reservations, 
Your beliefs, 
They are all too heavy to carry around, 
They are ugly and there is no reason to identify with them, 
They tack on to your mask like mud from the ground
[11:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Wow, there has been so much darkness in me
[11:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: There is only one way to effectively fight darkness
[11:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: To resolve it or remove it from your person
[11:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The only way to relieve yourself of darkness is to give out praises despite your feelings
[11:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Perhaps you are calling out to something else
[11:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: In any case, darkness does not like to be disturbed
[11:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Darkness will essentially hurt you if you try to remove it
[11:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: But better you remove it now by your own choice
[11:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Then forcefully removed, that is more painful
[11:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Darkness will make your ears hurt, the sting, the noise, the annoyance
[11:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It will grip you
[11:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: If you identify with it then it is you
[11:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: When you decide you don't want it anymore
[11:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: You become angry at it
[11:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: No one wants to be a victim
[11:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: So don't be
[11:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: You realize that fear was subtly manipulating you
[11:56 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: That there was an argument
[11:56 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And you were being convinced of that argument
[11:56 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: In order to fuck you
[12:01 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The modern man is quick to deny the existence of God
[12:01 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: But ask him of his torments and his demons
[12:01 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And he is quick to acknowledge his darkness
[12:01 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And we all know, or remember
[12:01 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: That if there is darkness there must too be light
