Far better it be to make others feel safe and comforted, 
Then to make oneself feel powerful and in control 

How much better it is to hold a person's trust than it is to hold a body
[11:41 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: This is to say 
In many words that I don't have the words yet to say 

Instead of wishing for a person, 
It is more rewarding to wish them well
[11:41 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It is more rewarding, 
To wish for them to be fulfilled in spirit, 
Then it is to wish that you could be fulfilled by them
[11:44 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: If you cast away your desire for them 
They will value you
Because you will give them the gift that no one else is giving them 

If you recognize their humanity as a being, and nothing else, if you value their presence and their existence and are content simply by this, not desiring anything else from them,
They will come to love you
And they also will never forget you 

But if you do this 
You will be holding something sacred
And if you cause harm to that 
You become like a graverobber
[11:47 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I had started winning people's hearts, 
And if I spoke of this, 
They did not understand what I meant. 

Then I played Persona 5, it seems Persona 5 understands something about winning hearts. 

There's certainly an understanding of beauty here when one comprehends the value of accumulating
 this kind of treasure
[11:48 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: On a related note, 
If you have not pursued mindfulness, 
You should and you should make it an active daily part of your life. 

It makes every part of your life better. 
In my case, 
It has just brought me back, 
To when my life is in complete flow and I am totally thriving
[11:48 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: This time I've had time to analyze what exactly does it mean when I am totally driving
[11:49 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Thriving
[11:49 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It means that my cup is overflowing in my soul 

I don't feel incredible or great, 
I feel overwhelmingly incredible, 
I feel abundantly great
[11:50 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Not even a short time ago, 
There were some great moments, but my overall experience was mostly of a spiritual starvation
[11:50 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I have analyzed the difference
[11:51 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: The first difference is as I have talked about, the priority is on my emotional well-being, 
Not what the world thinks of me
Not what I think I should be
But my current present state of well-being
[11:52 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: The second and larger difference has to do with the consumption of information
[11:57 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: This is when I have established a consistent daily routine of intaking information from multiple sources in small but digestible doses, 
Sources which fill my soul with richness of meaning and remind the mind of fresh life. 

The paradoxical and more difficult part of this consistency is a continual allowing of life to allow this information to enter into you at its pace and its timing, 

This is when the practice of Zen becomes a real living breathing experience, because it requires an active participation with the actual existence, 
It cannot be solely formulaic because it requires an active engagement and relationship with right now. 

This is regarding the same concept or related concept of having a personal relationship with a divine source.

This means relying partially on the intuition and available variables to determine what one should do right now to continue into the dance with life handing you that information while you receive it. 

This is where a deeper level of comprehension of the Tao is useful, 
In beginning to understand that the best thing that you can possibly do is to not force anything, to not push, 
to learn to relax and allow life to happen to you.

A simple way to say this is expecting and listening for life to hand you information as food, 
As opposed to forcing yourself to accumulate information. 

Surely there is wisdom needed on this complicated matter, 
Because you still need to position yourself around the information that life has for you.
[12:03 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Remember that life presents you information from many sources, 
Your emotions are information, 
Your dreams are information, 
Other people are information, 
Books and technology are information, 
Life problems and challenges are information, 

Life becomes more streamlined when you have a better hand at absorbing and processing that information in a refined process and effective systematic data processing routines. 

What I mean by systematic data processing routines is that your intuition and greater intelligence is fully equipped to understand how to best surf these waves of information in a conductive way.
[12:05 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Another way to say this, 
Is that you are processing the information from only the viewpoint of now, of one wave. 

Your intuition or greater intelligence is able to see all of the waves of information, as though these waves were white water rapids with many pathways and directions. 
Your greater intelligence is able to chart a course through these waves, 
knowing what kind of waves they are and how they should be approached and what routines should be used through them
[12:06 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: To stay consistent with the metaphor, 
It may be better to go slow through some waves, 
And fast through others,
It may be most prudent to come to a stop for a short while, 
To prepare for a big wave that the present attention does not know is on the horizon
[12:08 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Surely you've noticed that there were times in life when you begrudgingly were stuck at home unable to do anything, 
And shortly later there was a major event that happened in your life, 

Causing you to reflect on the fact that you actually needed that time of rest to prepare for what was coming, 
though you did not know
