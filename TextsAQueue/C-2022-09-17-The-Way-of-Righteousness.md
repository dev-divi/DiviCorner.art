> A new commandment I give to you, that you will love one another;  
as I have loved you,  
that you also love one another.  
By this all will know that you are My disciples,  
if you have love for one another.   


> If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you,  
you will ask what you desire,   
and it shall be done for you.  
By this My Father is glorified,  
that you bear much fruit; so you will be my disciples.  


I reread Proverbs and was paying attention to the word "way",

> Proverbs 8:2 "Wisdom..takes her stand..Beside the way..where the paths meet."  

>  8:38 "Blessed are those who keep my ways." 

>  11:28 "But the blameless in their ways are His delight" 

>  12:28 "In the way of righteousness is life, And in its pathway there is no death. 

>  13:6 "Righteousness guards him whose way is blameless." 

>  15:19 "The way of the upright is a highway." 

>  15:24 "The way of life winds upward for the wise, that he may turn away from hell below." 

>  16:7 "When a man's ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him."

>  16:9 "A man's heart plans his way, but (God) directs his steps."

> 16:17 "The highway of the upright is to depart from evil;  
He who keeps his way preserves his soul." 

> 19:3  "The foolishness of a man twists his way, and his heart frets against (God)" 

> 19:16 "He who keeps the commandments keeps his own soul, but he who is careless(literally despises) of his ways will die."
[12:50 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: 21:16
"He who wanders from the way of understanding 
Will rest in the assembly of the dead."
[12:51 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: 21:29 
"A wicked man hardens his face,
But as for the upright, he 
establishes (or understands) his way.
22:19 
"Hear, my son, and be wise;
And guide your heart in the way." 

23:26
"My son, give me your heart, 
And let your eyes observe my ways." 
[1:15 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: 29:27 The last proverb of Solomon
"an unjust man is an abomination to the righteous, 
And he who is upright in the way 
is an abomination to the wicked."
[1:19 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: 5:21 "The ways of man are before the eyes of (God), And He ponders all of his paths."
[1:24 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I didn't include every verse, with all included I see a theme that says basically that following righteousness is a sort of unfolding hidden pathway that others cannot see, 
in which by focusing on wisdom instead of what others are focusing on you gain the benefits of having wisdom and now the way becomes more clear and automatic and you are also gaining more wealth and wisdom as a result of the wisdom you are now acting out.

--- Additional Scriptures 

13:20
He who walks with wise men will be wise,
But the companion of fools will be destroyed.
[1:29 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: 18:21
Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat of its fruit
[I cannot help thinking of an earlier verse where he says, 
"Divination is on the lips of the king" 
Which means to me, that the king who speaks life will create life in his kingdom, 
His words will manifest life. 

I believe the context of the associated verses around this back me up on this meaning.
[1:31 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: 17:8 
"A present is a precious stone in the eyes of it's oppressor. Wherever he turns, he prospers."

I cannot help wanting to switch present with "presence", 
His presence causing him to prosper wherever he turns

-- Additional Reading, Finances 

[1:32 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: A few financial proverbs 
[1:33 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the person who oppresses the poor to increase his riches, 
as well as the person who gives money to the rich, will come to poverty.
[1:35 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: When you are sit down to eat with a ruler..
Do not desire his delicacies, they are deceptive food.

Do not overwork to be rich, 
because of (your limited understanding?), stop! 

Why would you set your eyes on that which is not (the riches you wish you had do not exist!) 

Riches certainly make themselves wings(ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸) 
They fly away like an eagle toward heaven. 
[1:38 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: -
A verse I will compare to Christ's words
25:21
"If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; 
if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. "
(Then it basically says he will be hurt by this and you will be rewarded by this)
[1:39 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: -
27:2 
"Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth;
A stranger; and not your own lips."
