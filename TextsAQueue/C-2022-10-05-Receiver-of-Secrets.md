The tale of the two sons
[1:04 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨:  “What do you think about this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’

“‘I will not,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.

“Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.

“Which of the two did what his father wanted?”

“The first,” they answered.

Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the (taxman) and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you (priests). For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. 
[1:05 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: When I read this, I feel consolation. 
I have been the man who said, "I will not go".
[1:05 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: but later I changed my mind and went.
[1:05 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: There are others who still say they will go and have not gone.
[1:10 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Maybe the rich man will come back to Jesus later, 
maybe later on he tries to fill the void with his wealth, 
and remembers Jesus' words, 
and repents, 
and goes and gives to the poor. 

Jesus told him that if he did this he would receive a reward from heaven and then to follow after him. 

Perhaps the reward from heaven would be the fulfillment of this free love to give. Then, with that Love, he could follow after Jesus on his own, 
that is, to follow after the master's way.
[1:12 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Then 
Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures:

“‘The stone the builders rejected
    has become the cornerstone;
the Lord has done this,
    and it is marvelous in our eyes’?

 “Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”

When the priests and heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he was talking about them.

Jesus just got finished saying the prostitutes are better than the priests, 
and now he is saying that the kingdom of God will be taken from the priests and will be given to someone else. 
[1:14 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: This is his story, 
A landowner planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.
Then he sent his son there and they killed his son. 
So he will come back and stop renting to them.
[1:14 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I understand the parable as this.
[1:18 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: My interpretation is God created a church. He built a wall around it. He dug a fountain of good Spirit. He gave it to men to keep. 

But the men he gave it to were wicked.
[1:19 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Now, he has returned, and he now gives the spirit to the prostitutes and low-lifes, the druggies and the rejects.
[1:20 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Then, the kingdom of God will be taken away from the Christians and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
[1:21 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The Christians are the second son who answered, 
"I will, sir", but did not go. 

The real ones are the ones who answered, "I will not," but later changed their mind and went.
[1:22 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The real ones are the ones who went, "No. I'm an atheist. No, I won't do it." but after a while, they changed their mind and went. 
Because they had good planted inside them and that mustard seed grew out and became the dominant force in them.
[1:24 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Now, the stone the builders rejected 
The rejects, the outcasts, the artists, the sensitives, the poors, the weakest members of society
they become the actual foundations of the real church that has the real spirit. 
They produce its fruit, 
and you will know them by their fruit. 
[1:36 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Jesus would have been against the established christian and catholic churches, for the same reason of all of us. 

He hated them because they were hypocrites then. 
The same hypocrites then are the same hypocrites now. 
The world has not changed. 

The world hates christians because they are people who say what to do and do not live it. 
Jesus told this exact story as the parable of two sons I just shared. 

You could say that he predicted this and said a parable about it.
[1:46 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Jesus did not fight for the church.
[1:46 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: There is a key here
[1:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Jesus was not with the church because the church were hypocrites
[1:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: However
[1:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Jesus also did not go out and live a lifestyle of gluttony and pleasure, and he surely could have.
[1:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Instead, 
Jesus went around speaking to people and talking about ancient scriptures, and talking about following the ten commandments
[1:49 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: How can a man who is against the church be preaching to follow the ten commandments?
[1:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: He explains this in these parables. The church has taken the scriptures. 
The church is wicked and hypocritical. 

But those are Jesus' Father's scriptures. 
Jesus is on a vengeance mission. 
He is taking back his inheritance, his people's inheritance, 
Those scriptures are his birthright, 
the church stole them from him and did not understand what the scriptures meant.
[1:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The church does not invalidate the value of the scriptures to a person's life
[1:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The church is not so evil that it can take a good thing and make it actually bad. 
They do not have this power.
[1:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: the scriptures were intended to be received through love in your heart.
you basically have to have the vibration or brainwaves of love active to receive what the author was sharing 
[1:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Jesus hated the church, he hated the priests, he hated the hypocrites, 
and yet he still picked up their bibles and read from them to the people 
because the wisdom was in the scriptures from the wise men who came before and recorded their highest knowledge and truth
[1:56 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and he did it because goodness was more important than whether or not the priests had tainted his preferences for scripture
[1:58 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and that's why the crowds loved him
[1:59 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: he was taking the wisdom from these scriptures and giving them out freely to people 
he was giving them the healing of forgiveness spoken about in proverbs 
he was giving them the secrets in David's psalms
