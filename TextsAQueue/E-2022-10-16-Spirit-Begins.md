I experienced the human spirit breaking out, 
Crying out,
It was screaming wake up wake up
I don't know if this means that we really are in a dream 
That this was only possible because this woman has her focus on this, 
Because she's crying out for it earnestly, 
Because she has taken what is pure in her heart and screamed out to let it out, passed her flesh and her self
[4:08 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And I find that once again, surely there was no person in me
Surely I was only full of desires, 
And when all those desires are gone,
There's no one left. 

And the days before were torturous. 
The light of others filled my soul, 
But I was trapped in a purgatory of comfort from their light
And yet wanting more
Wanting to be closer to them
Wanting to not be separate from them  
Especially women 
And now here is this woman
Her image to me is perfection 
Both in physical and spiritual beauty

I have never seen a woman more connected to white light
I could even see that she was praying for my spirit to break out

I could see that she sees my spirit as well. 

<!--
And I'm so confused
Because I cannot tell if I desire her
I cannot tell if I want more
I can't tell what I want from her
Unlike others I'm attracted to, 
I do not feel pulled towards her. 

Actually my distance is kept from her. 

When I sense my spiritual connection with other beings, 
Especially those very high in light
There is usually a bond.
[4:15 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: With this woman instead of a bond, I  sense a giant wall of light. It is a thick barrier. 
At first I thought that this was simply her presence,
But now I think this is actually our two souls in contact. 

I have asked God if this means that she is a sister
[4:15 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I've had no indication that she is a sister
[4:17 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And for some reason when I think of her 
I think about David. 
David's worst crime
He saw a woman and he wanted her. 
She was married. 
He had her husband killed. 

If I were to want this woman and she was not for me 
Would I want to murder her husband to marry her?
[4:18 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: The worst part is when I go to this other church, 

If I lose that purity in my soul that I'm tasting right now 

I don't know what I will do when I can't find it again.
