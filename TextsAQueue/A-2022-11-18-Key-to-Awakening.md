Love is the actual key to awakening
[11:49 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Love is the actual key to awakening out of blindness
[11:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Love is the actual focus that breaks one out of the fictional self created perceptions and into reality
[11:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Love is the actual doorway into reality
[11:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I have been here
[11:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I cannot express my gratitude
[11:51 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I have been listening to the same music, searching for a sound, for months, every day
[11:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I have heard a sound and followed it
[11:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: In real life as well
[11:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I have not known what that sound was
[11:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It is under the screaming of praise
[11:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It is a sound that comes from outside of the blindness
[11:52 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It is a sound that comes from outside the box we are in
[11:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It is a sound of the heavens
[11:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and I kept following it
[11:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and I found what it was
[11:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It was a holy temple in my soul
[11:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I did not believe that it was possible to restore my soul into a temple
[11:53 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: My soul has been filled with many lies and much darkness
[11:54 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Many voices have told me it was not possible to repurpose a soul that has been damaged so significantly
[11:55 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I will not rest 
I will not hold my peace 
Until her righteousness goes forth as brightness 
And her salvation as a lamp that burns
