I don't know how to explain this
[11:18 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the heart, the soul, you have to pour new wine into it, and that will create a new wineskin
[11:18 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but you can't pour new wine into an old wineskin
[11:19 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: for many people, listening to some of this music would be pouring new wine into an old wineskin
[11:19 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: your soul has to acclimate to rise
[11:19 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: much like or even parallel to the stages of grief
[11:19 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: it seems you cannot start with pure praise
[11:19 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: pure light will burn you
[11:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: as people say, "I can't go into a church, haha, I would burn alive from all the demons in me"
[11:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: you have to expose your soul to a taste
[11:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: and let your soul acclimate
[11:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: you are moving your soul from a direction of mourning towards praise
[11:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: from depression towards praise

[11:21 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: holy F, the statement she makes
[11:22 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: A story was shared with me
[11:23 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: A people were shown a different way to live
[11:23 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: When they saw the way they had been living, they wanted to mourn
[11:24 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But the prophets were saying to them, 
that this is not the time for mourning,
[11:24 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: it is the time, it is the season, it is the hour, 
this is the time to drink, to eat your fill, to be merry
[11:26 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: This message means that people who turn from darkness, there is no time to waste, 
Christ would have said, "the kingdom of the heavens is nearby, it is upon you", 

I or a modern translation would have said, "the dimension of the Presence of eternity and life is right next to us, this is the moment to press in"
[11:26 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: This is the verse that has been revealed to me
[11:27 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Look at the fig tree, and all the trees. 
When they are already budding, you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near. 

So you also, when you see these [previously mentioned in the chapter] things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near." 
[11:30 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: This is another way to say, 
You can have the manifest Presence of God, the Presence of Consciousness awake in your being, and yes everyone will flock to you and all things will go well from you, 

but the dimension of that Presence of Consciousness being stepped through as a door, that is an entire reality. That does not affect one person, that affects every living creature in that area. 
The area is affected by the superseding dimension. 

What I am speaking of is real. What I am speaking of is all of the fish becoming aware that they are breathing water
[11:30 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Remember that we are swimming in pure consciousness, that is why we know it is always near, 

but sometimes it is the time and it is the hour to step into it
[11:30 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: that time is near
[11:32 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: remember the lovers, the stars aligned, it seems the whole world was for them, everything went their way, 
it is similar, 

there is a time a season an hour a moment when the stars align, that is the time to take your fill
[11:34 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: this is to say that God might ask for your repentance to let go of something affecting you, 
but he is not asking for your sorrows following it, 
the time of the wedding feast is here, 
it is time to eat and be full.
