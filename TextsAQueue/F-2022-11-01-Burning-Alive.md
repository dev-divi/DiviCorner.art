[1:14 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I believe it is a legitimate statement when people say, "I can't go into church, I'd burn alive with all of the demons in me"
[1:14 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Sometimes we need that burn
[1:15 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It is worth considering that right now you can walk into a measure of that burn by your own will
[1:16 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: In this same way, you may not be able to experience the phenomenon of some music if your soul has not acclimated to it
[1:16 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Until you are harmonizing with it in your being
[1:17 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: To not harmonize with it at all is to walk into a solid wall
[1:18 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I am not someone who is always in the light
[1:18 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: In my life I have walked up down and around
[1:19 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I have gone from resonating with this music to being burned by it to being annoyed by it to hating it to resonating it again, in many orders
[1:19 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I have heard the same music and experienced it differently many times
[1:20 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The same song that meant nothing to me was at another time a completely meaningful experience
[1:20 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: A lot of it has to do with how we listen
[1:20 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And what we assume
[1:20 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Most of my life people have told me things and I assumed what they meant
[1:21 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: An example is in many parts of my life, Christians pushing their dogma on me made me angry
[1:22 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Their insistence that there is only one way and one Christ infuriated me
[1:22 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: But I did not understand what they were saying
[1:23 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: They were saying that they had stumbled upon a truth more true than anything they had ever found
[1:23 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And they were testifying to its existence
[1:24 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Importantly to make the comparison to something else in this world, they would tell you, "no, it isn't like that", 
which is just as infuriating
[1:24 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Some of us haven't tasted light
[1:25 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Most of us have had a taste but we are such slaves to our multitudes of desire that we have no appetite for light in our soul
[1:26 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: we have filled our soul with murky water
[1:26 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And after being empty, filling clean water into a dirty cup, it does not feel good
[1:26 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: In my case I often go to such extremes that it almost feels damaging, the difference
[1:27 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It's not a battle we have to worry too much about though
[1:27 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Because over time, the salt of most desire loses its flavor
[1:27 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: this is painful because it leads us to starvation
[1:28 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and to find the source that will maintain us is often difficult
[1:28 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: especially if we are not acclimated to eating it
[1:29 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and between the slave of desire, and the one who wants freedom, this is a war
[1:42 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I believe it is also possible to observe the self that is between this war
[1:43 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: First you have to see that you are always serving a master
[1:43 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Man likes to believe he is his own master
[1:44 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: But you did not invent your desires
[1:44 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: they appeared before you
[1:44 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: You did not invent woman
[1:44 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: she appeared before you
[1:44 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: you did not create your desire for her
[1:44 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: it arose out of your soul
[1:44 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: and you became its servant
[1:44 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Everything you want is what you serve
[1:46 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: status, money, control, being right, validation, beauty, these are all masters
[1:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: notice and catalogue all that you think you want and all that you really want
[1:47 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: see if you can stop wanting anything
[1:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The way I have been following has included "stay hungry"
[1:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: In contrasting this with the fulfillment of desire
[1:48 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Staying hungry I have noticed is not fulfilling a desire
[1:49 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I am fairly certain that the ones who practice 'staying hungry' are not aware in any way of this
[1:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: 'stay hungry' means to not be satisfied, to want more of what god has
[1:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: this is after you have developed a taste
[1:50 AM]The Blessed 🧞✨: it's similar to momentum
