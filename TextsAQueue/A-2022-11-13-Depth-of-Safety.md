Today deep mistrust for others arises out of me, I despise my many masks, all is threatening. 
I become aware of hidden judgement, curses from others
[4:20 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Whether a delusion or a reality, 
There is a new capacity for care
[4:22 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: At what level of safety was I triggered
[4:22 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Was a deep, deep level of safety
[4:23 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And the devil, just as quick to tell me I didn't belong there
[4:23 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The richness in that depth of safety
[4:23 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: As though an archeological finding revealed that the dirt once possessed living gold
[4:23 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The catacombs of real experience
[4:24 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Truly there are only two directions
[4:25 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Truly I am learning the secret of the golden flower without even studying the secret of the golden flower
[4:25 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And to stand upon contentment
[4:26 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: To be revealed that fulfilment is fulfilling
[4:26 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The desire is no longer for what cannot be grasped
[4:26 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The desire is being fulfilled while it is being grasped, there is satisfaction in the drink, the thirst does not go unquenched


[4:29 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Earlier I saw a relationship with an invisible center point
[4:29 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Trust - Stillness

[4:30 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: A song was played yesterday, far too deep for me
[4:30 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: It contained the words
"Deep is filling into deep" 
Or "deep is spilling unto deep" 
One of the two
[4:31 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I need trust to meet me in the middle with stillness
[4:32 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: In the center of all things is truly perfection
[4:32 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And we are at the center of this world
[4:32 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: We are perfection upon perfection
[4:32 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Perfection refining itself infinitely
[4:33 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The difficulty in trust and stillness
[4:33 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Is external validation that the situation is okay
[4:35 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: This is why we need real faith, and why faith is understanding
[4:36 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: You have to have the understanding that everything is okay and stand upon that understanding
[4:36 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: When you understand that you are the validator
[5:11 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Recognizing and allowing interrupts our habitual patterning
[5:22 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And whatever we recognize loses its power
[6:53 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I saw white glimmering pearl globes surrounded by golden streams of light..
[11:26 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Tonight I sat around a table with a few key people in this city
[11:27 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I learned some
[11:27 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: One key here, 
If you are looking for results with god in prayer
[11:28 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: Instead of asking what you want from him in order to feel better
[11:28 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The way this man said it was, I think,
"Minister to God"
[11:29 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I think he said, 
"Tell him of good things, 
Tell him of what you are rejoicing in"
[11:30 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: And it causes something to happen
[11:31 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: The way I connected it was David's Psalms, 
"I bless Your name" 
"I bless You God"
[11:31 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I bless the blesser
[11:31 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: I am pouring blessing back into the one who blesses and he is going to spill back into me
[11:32 PM]The Blessed 🧞✨: This is to not aim to fix the darkness of the moment but to rejoice in the day despite them
