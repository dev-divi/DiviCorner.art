[1:05 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: There is a reason we look for what is between duality 
There is a purpose to this philosophy 
Between being and non-being
Silence and sound 
Darkness and Light 

This is a place the mind cannot go 
and with this realization 

The Being might awaken.

There is no beauty like when a human heart opens to you to reveal a love and fire inside of it
 I have come to a place where I no longer want to speak out loud to anyone
[5:50 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: To speak of beauty is to destroy it
[5:50 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: To hold it is to hold it in silence
[5:50 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: By speaking I might move away from it
