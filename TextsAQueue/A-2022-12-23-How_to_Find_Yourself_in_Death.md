[4:17 PM] @0xdivi ðŸ§žâœ¨: There is a joke meme out there that captures the idea that sleep 
is like a nightly ritual in which we prepare for death, 
in this ritual we use little deaths to prepare for the final death.
[4:19 PM] @0xdivi ðŸ§žâœ¨: death is one of the few things that all of us have in common 
[4:20 PM] @0xdivi ðŸ§žâœ¨: I have experienced near-death events but so have many other people, 
people who have done drugs have experienced leaving the body as well, 
and people completely sober have experienced leaving the body as well
[4:23 PM] @0xdivi ðŸ§žâœ¨: In death and its mystery is the greatest of lessons and explorations, it forces us to consider what has meaning and how valuable that meaning is, and what it means to us if that meaning goes away. 
Our mind, our brain is a problem solver and threat detection sensor and it is at all times aware of all threats and it always knows its biggest threat, death, is inevitably coming to take it away. Almost everything human beings do is an attempt to escape the permanence of death in some form
[4:25 PM] @0xdivi ðŸ§žâœ¨: But we are not our mind. And our body is only a vessel. 
However we are also not many other things we believe we are, 
and this is what you find when you look for yourself. 

"I searched for myself and I found only God, 
I searched for God and found only myself"
[4:29 PM] @0xdivi ðŸ§žâœ¨: When we start with death, when we're afraid to die, we hide away, we're miserable and we live in a state of torment, in the awareness that something can hurt us and take us away. 

There is a stage where you are strong enough to face the fear of death and learn that death is exciting. It is the possibility of new. It's a surprise, a mystery box. We love mysteries, and death is the ultimate surprise, it's such a surprise that no one can reveal it to you. 
Additionally the more you get exhilerated by facing the threat of your mortality, the more alive you become, the more clear your vision and clarity, and the more you can find a reason to live. Death assists your perspective to see how you can be living differently.
[4:32 PM] Weeb3 Jonaseu: Okay okay okay, we need to die in dream before we can find a reason to live.
[4:34 PM] @0xdivi ðŸ§žâœ¨: Where I'm at right now, after you've searched for yourself for a while, you realize that you have already died in many ways, and you have to ask which way would you need to die in order to stop existing. 

You see that the threat is true, you who exist right now cannot go to the place in the future. It is impossible for you to travel to where you don't exist anymore. Later there will be someone else, it will not be you. Just as you are not now the person you were. 
There is no reason to be concerned with this process. 
The awareness of being is going to fade and appear elsewhere again, and who knows where it will be, 
and there will be pain and suffering that is unbearable, just as there will be great loves and joys and ecstacys and beauty.
[4:35 PM] @0xdivi ðŸ§žâœ¨: facing the fear of death in any way is helpful to our lives, it also prompts us to stop running the rat race and look at reality, gives us a moment to stop and consider changing. 
[4:43 PM] @0xdivi ðŸ§žâœ¨: As for what lies on the other side of the mystery, 
my full current understanding takes into consideration certain factors. 
1. your conscious waking reality is not reality. It is an analysis of all the data in your existence tightened to a state where you the person feels a sense of control over your life, this control consistently for all parties appears to be keeping the awareness of being limited to you from one body and establishing an identification with that body. 
Were you in actual reality, you would be seeing all of the data available. 

2. When you are asleep, I believe you have access to the exact same data as you did in the waking reality, but now that you are no longer controlling your reality, you see this data closer to what it actually is, coming into your mind to be processed. It is not chance that it is also possible to fly and manipulate reality in other ways in dreams, and access certain other abilitise in dreams, as this dream data is less filtered and processed, it is closer to actual reality. So in my model: Reality > Dream > Physical
[5:00 PM] @0xdivi ðŸ§žâœ¨: With this data I know for certain 1 thing that will happen when you die, which also can happen if you take mind altering drugs. 

For certain, when you die you will lose control. You will not be able to control your reality from the perspective of one body. This is the real fear. 
The completely toxic society that has developed has mostly developed out of trying to avoid this fear. Control has become paramount to the "American lifestyle" as a band-aid to this threat.

The only thing to fear is this loss of control, but when you think about it, this limited tiny perspective is not all of you, you have a larger awareness that understands and knows much more 
[ and also consistently across human lives when accessed has love and knows all is okay, perfect, beautiful ]
Most of us have temporarily experienced moments where we were aware of much more, having "glimpses of eternity" of some sort. 
When you lose control, your awareness is going to expand to what it really is because you won't be able to control it anymore. You'll become all you really are. 

If you can understand this, you'd see that only the limited and shallow perspective of a person is afraid of all of this happening, because it's scared of not being there anymore.
 
But it is not even really lost so much as we become aware of more, and in becoming aware of more we are not what we were. 
When you can see that you can see that it's really amazing and exciting. 

You can also see part of why there is so much fear in this loss of control. When you lose control, you will see all of your secrets, all the parts of you that you hate, all of your worst thoughts and desires, everything you wanted to keep under control, you will have no control over any of it. You'll even lose the power that comes with control. 
[5:00 PM] @0xdivi ðŸ§žâœ¨: But the way reality works, at higher levels of understanding, ideas that are more aligned with reality, lower ideas that aren't true just eradicate themselves. 

So as you lose control and start to look at reality, you begin to lose false ideas, lies, some bad, some that you used to make your ego feel better, you lose all the fiction you used to protect you from vulnerability. In a real way, when you die you go through the hellfire that burns off all of this from you as you move to a larger understanding, and this is painful, but only to the limited part of you. To your soul, this pain is relieving, the relieving of dirt that got stuck on you, the healing of what light that dirt tried to cover up. That dirt, lies, always cover up the light of the truth, 
that is consistently the same, that you are good, that you matter, that you have value, that you are loved, that you aren't alone. 
The only reason it hurts to think you are alone is because of how far away from truth it is. 
We come from truth, and when you lose truth, it hurts.
