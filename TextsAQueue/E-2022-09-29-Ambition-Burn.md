[1:50 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Expend too much effort and you will be the first employee to quit.
[1:50 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Expend no effort and you will outlast all of your peers
[2:15 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Remove the carrot from the stick and eat the carrot
[2:36 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I'm at a place right now where I have come through chaos
[2:36 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I'm basically learning to control an unbelievably large fire
[7:29 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I found out following this that someone else was hit psychologically in the same way last night, 
And it passed by them and brought them to a place not unlike my current state as well


[1:11 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I survived the most dangerous part of my life
[1:11 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I had fallen into true chaos
[1:12 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: My soul became a black hole
[1:12 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was able to rise above this
[1:12 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: My soul has become a white hole.
[1:12 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Every breath I take in is pure light
[1:13 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I have had the opportunity on this day to allow God to speak through me to others

[1:13 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I have relinquished
[1:13 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: my desires
[1:13 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: which are many

[1:15 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Man's disappointment, his shame, negative stories, negative thoughts and head trips, these have faded from importance
[1:16 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It is almost as though the storm of chaos is circling around me yet far away from me, and all of that negativity is being caught up in it 

While I become a halo ring
[1:16 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And I am resting within the ring
[1:17 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Between life and death 
Between male and female 
Between something or other
[1:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I admit, there is nothing more terrifying than what I had just gone into. 
I have been terrified of many experiences. 
The terror of your soul becoming a black hole and experiencing it
