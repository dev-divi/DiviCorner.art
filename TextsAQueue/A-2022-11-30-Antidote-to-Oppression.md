He who has an ear, let him hear!
[2:04 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: This is the beginning of Isaiah 61. Isaiah 61 is one of the most revered prophesies in the church. 
The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me,
Because the Lord has anointed Me
To preach good tidings to the poor;
He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted,
To proclaim liberty to the captives,
And the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
2To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,
And the day of vengeance of our God;
To comfort all who mourn,
To console those who mourn in Zion,
To give them beauty for ashes,
The oil of joy for mourning,
The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness;
That they may be called trees of righteousness,
The planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified.‚Äù
[2:13 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: Key takeaways of what happens when the Spirit is upon us and annoints us, at a critical moment, there is:

- good tidings to poor 
- healing the brokenhearted 
- proclaim [inner] freedom to those in captivity 
- open the [psychological] prisons that men are trapped inside

- comfort the mourning 
- give consolation to the mourning in their soul 
- give beauty to replace where there was nothing left but ash 
- give the oil of joy to those who mourn, to coat them in a layer of supernatural joy [which also causes healing when it outpours in a public arena] 
- the garment of praise is also a coat and layer to cast down upon them, this layer of praise causing the spirit of heaviness to be lifted, 
this new coating causes their identities to shift into identities which are now standing as strong as trees, with their base being righteousness, and their foundation planted as the Lord, which also brings glory to the Lord. That is to say, standing strong as these pillars is a testimony to the Lord who would give joy, praise, strength, 
another way to say that is even, 
they stand as proof of the power of praise, the power of of joy, the power of console, the power of preaching good tidings, the power of healing.
[2:13 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: Here is the end of Isaiah 61
[2:14 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: I will greatly rejoice in the Lord,
My soul shall be joyful in my God;

For He has clothed me with the garments of salvation,
He has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
As a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments,
And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

For as the earth brings forth its bud,
As the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth,
So the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
[2:19 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: So notice that by taking the action of rejoicing in [the god of goodness], 
the result is being joyful [in rejoicing for that], 

the result of rejoicing in this goodness also causes a coat of the identity of salvation, man who has salvation, what is salvation? salvation is like being lifted from the low place up to first place, to be brought into singing. There is probably a more accurate answer than that. 
He also gets a coat of righteousness. 

Now, again he explains that to invoke this praise, this rejoicing, 
the result includes a springing forth externally. 
Now he is saying that God is also an active invoking force, 
and that now God also, that which is greater than us, 
is also going to invoke that which results in righteousness and praise to spread widespread. 

From our point of view, your praise is contagious, 
god has caused your heart to stir in order to praise, 
and the righteousness you gain is going to stir others to praise, 
and this will be visible by the world.
[2:20 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: So consider these concepts in terms of these lyrics,
[2:20 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6_BLuhr0HQ&list=RD0uUwIiBaStE&index=13&ab_channel=BATLMusic
[2:20 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: they are, 
you are good! 
you are good! 
you are good! 
you are good!
[2:21 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: when you make declarations of praise like that
[2:21 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: something happens in your soul
[2:21 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: when something happens in your soul
[2:25 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: something inside you arises, 
this causes the heaviness upon you to be shifted, 
and that which is good inside you arises, 
and a righteousness which you did not know was there is evoked out of you. 

This is the truth that the earth does not understand, this is not just magic, this is who we really are. It is an oppressive society, a society of heaviness which has been convincing all of us to not sing the praises which cause that heaviness to lift, and your soul under it to arise. 
Those who understand that understand that this is a war, 
and the war involves leading people toward becoming exposed to this. 

Nations who praise also become sustainable and healthy, the heaviness does not sit upon the families and the fathers, there is freedom, there is the spirit of life across the network.
[2:29 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: This is real, this is no lie. This is a methodology that is far more powerful than you can know. It is not shallow and normal like positivity. I am speaking of something that can change nations, that can change a life, that can remove the problems, that can cause the heavy to feel instead that one is elevating.
[2:29 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: I reveal this at my lowest point
[2:31 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: it's difficult to make decisions to change to do things like remove heaviness from us
[2:31 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: there is a lot of self in the way from the freedom to even do that
[2:32 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: there's who you think you are and what you think you do,
there's the opinions you've drawn, your feelings of preference, 
your attachment to beliefs, 
all of these things are used against you by the oppressive system
[2:33 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: a system you perpetuate by giving control to your mind
[2:33 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: the best way to solve this is to associate yourself with people who are praising
[2:34 AM]The Blessed üßû‚ú®: this will cause you to change by association
