[1:08 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Then, as I was writing all of this, I stumbled upon an unbelievable discovery
[1:09 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Alan Watts, Osho and others have stated that the Buddha noted that when he returned, he would return not as the master, but that he would return as the friend.

Jesus must have had the same teaching, for he says,

You are my friends if you do what I command.

I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his masterâ€™s business.

Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.

You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit â€” fruit that will last â€” and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you.

This is my command: Love each other.
