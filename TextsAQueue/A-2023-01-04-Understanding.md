> "If you don't die before you die, you won't die when you die." 

A master would have said,  
this is because you can't die if you never lived.  

What it says in [this video]() is the truth

The person I was before a near-death or death experience..   
I believed I was me.  

I did not know who I was, not even 1%  

I don't know if others would agree with me or if they've thought about this long enough  

but how do I say this, you know how "other people don't know who you really are"

that you that you "really are" isn't you, your potential self, it isn't you,

it's the same potential self that is humanity

the way I see it is it's actually one being

one human being

with the same personality

the same mind

not a whole bunch of minds all together to form a supercomputer or something

it's just the same real self

---

the authentic self is the same real self that manifests itself out of us when we aren't trying to be who we think we are

that's the reason you won't die when you die,   
because your limited self isn't who you are,  

and if you never taste who you are

then you don't come to know that you aren't something that lives or dies  

this is why the zen masters don't try to do anything  

because there isn't anything to do

because the real self is fine

because basically if you look at the timeline

there is a period of time where mankind's heart is closed

but it will inevitably open, that's what it does

just like breathing happens in and out

it closes for a while, it will open later

as long as you have some will you can close it

but limited will is temporary, it can't hold its strength for all that long
[4:09 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the reason why we participate in goodness
[4:09 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: is to reduce the amount of suffering during that process
[4:09 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: this is the same reason as why increasing suffering for spiritual gain is insane
[4:09 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: there is going to be suffering either way
[4:09 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but it can be eased
[4:10 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: making it worse to accelerate the timeline is what people try to do
[4:10 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: many of them because they want to perceive the change during their lifetime
[4:11 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: i've never heard anyone who understood or knew of the real self describe eternal hell
[4:12 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: it seems to be a misunderstanding of what people were trying to tell them and how their mind interpreted it
[4:12 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I could be wrong, but the data doesn't match up with our awareness going to eternal hell
[4:13 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: it would be more likely that if you never woke up, your awareness would dissolve back into the greater awareness after death, 
 which is not like dying really, that would be more like zooming out the picture back to silence
[4:14 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: it would be more like saying a sound doesn't die, it fades back into the silence
[4:15 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the problem humans would have with this is that it would mean there was no justice for those who have done evil to them
[4:15 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but for those so willing to believe every word of scripture as "gospel", 
it says that god does not even remember sin
[4:16 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: of what i have experienced of the power of consciousness, 
in the face of consciousness, demons are driven out, darkness cannot resonate into it, 
humans are actually freed from darkness in the face of consciousness
[4:18 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: humans have such duality because they believe multiple things simultaneously that cannot fit together 
they believe that sin must be paid for, 
but they also believe that their dead ones in heaven love them. 
These two beliefs do not fit together. 
Man has no way to reconcile this. He has to think of one or think of the other at a different time, he can't think of both at once.
[4:18 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: He asks, how could a god allow this kind of suffering
[4:18 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: which is another way later of asking a deeper question, 
how could love love evil
[4:18 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: and the answer is simple, but people don't like simple answers
[4:19 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: there are two statements: 
evil doesn't exist 
and 
evil doesn't exist
[4:19 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the first statement says, "there is no such thing as evil" 
the second statement has to do with reality and illusion. 
Illusions exist but they are illusions, they fade away when you look at them.
[4:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Darkness exists as an illusion
[4:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: When love looks at it, it disappears
[4:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: This is not actually philosophy
[4:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: This is actually what it looks like when the physical world experiences a taste of consciousness
[4:21 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: When consciousness comes into a space with humans, 
the darkness from the humans is cleared out of their minds and they see light
[4:21 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the simple answer is that there is no space for evil in the presence of love
[4:22 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: when consciousness invades a space, the evil is gone, 
but the humans remain
[4:22 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: whatever evil was in that human is gone
[4:22 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: whatever good is left inside of them is left
[4:22 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: now they say that some people have no good inside of them
[4:23 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: this is inaccurate factually, joy and even pleasure are related to goodness
[4:23 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: all humans desire things that are good in various forms, they seek it
[4:24 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the worst crimes of humanity are misguided attempts at obtaining light
[4:24 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: every crime is an attempt to gain light
[4:25 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: some people believe they do not believe there is goodness but this is also not true, 
if they believe in crime, they believe in goodness. 
to measure something as a crime is to measure that something bad occurred to good 
[4:27 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I have encountered people completely consumed by lust to the point that there is nothing else in them, they are just an animal, they would rape, steal, kill, without thought
[4:27 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but even this person simply wants to have what they don't have
[4:27 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: they want goodness and don't know how to get it
[4:27 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: and the reason
[4:28 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the reason they are like an animal
[4:28 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: is because animals have no depth
[4:28 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: that person has no depth to them
[4:28 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: their actual crime is that they aren't deep enough to know how to pursue any kind of goodness within themselves
[4:29 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but because goodness is actually the fundamental intrinsic human need
[4:29 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: that light is actually necessary to survival
[4:29 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: they have to rape someone else to take their light in order to have a taste of goodness in order to not die
[4:30 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the body actually gives out when it has no light in it, it physically dies
[4:30 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the widow dies of heartbreak and sorrow, her light has left her
[4:30 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: another widow might not die of heartbreak and sorrow, she has her own light
[4:31 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the savages, the animalistic brutes have hardness of heart to love
[4:31 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but the thinkers, they also have a hardness of heart to love
[4:32 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: what this world cannot soften their heart to, because they have not yet received it, is love to evil
[4:35 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: this world says, "unconditional love" and they mean, "accept me no matter what I do" 
that is not even you. 
the world cannot soften their heart to actual unconditional love until receiving it, 
unconditional love is loving what is impossible to be loved. 
It is impossible for us to love evil. 
To love evil, we might even risk accepting that evil and taking it into ourselves, not advisable 

but the actual gift of unconditional love is the possibility that a person underneath their evil can be loved, 
this is redemption. 
Man in his mind cannot accept this because he knows of the atrocities of others, not even the worst of crimes, but the simple judgements, not to mention their own failures
[4:37 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: it's easy to hate the violent
[4:38 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but the politicians, manipulators, psychological oppressors, abusers, the religious, they share the same crime as the violent, 
they also have no light, and are taking it from those who do in order to survive
[4:39 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: we see the exchange physically, i kill you, take your stuff, 
then i'm unsatisfied, kill more people, take more stuff, 
in my head i'm killing for the stuff, 
but in reality i'm looking to eat bread, and there is a little morsel of bread in the stuff that i'm taking, 
but it isn't enough to sustain, so you gotta keep killing, keep taking stuff, just to get by
[4:40 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: and you know what, it turns out torture ends up being a little more fulfilling than just taking stuff, 
there's some power in torture, makes you feel a bit elevated
[4:40 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: that elevation is the light that is being taken
[4:41 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: this is why people on that path become more and more evil, because the more evil actions they can take, 
the more light they can sustain themselves on
[4:47 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the richest are starving, completely starving. they are completely suicidal, their existence is hell, and they know it. no matter what they eat or drink they feel one step closer to death
[4:47 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: their unsatisfaction grows as their wealth grows because they are more surrounded by what is not sustaining them
[4:48 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: unfortunately, when there is no bread, they are not just starving, but with no light, there is nothing to shield them from darkness, and that darkness becomes their heart
[4:49 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: it manifests out of them in every conceivable way and fills their mind with fear and dis-ease and neurosis
[4:51 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: notice in contrast that there are successful people, look at how they live their lives, look at what they do, 
they are light generators, even if they do not know it, even if their minds are spiritually blind, they spread light and that light becomes tangible wealth that is sustainable, 
others try to tear them down for an exchange of that light, 
if you can bring a successful person down, you gain a measure of their light
[4:52 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: religion is highly skilled at taking light from a person with light, through means of psychological oppression and limitation
[4:53 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: ever notice that people with open hearts don't really need a religion, they don't really need a way to live, they already have what they need
[4:53 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but religion tries to convince them that it is otherwise
[4:54 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: then it weaponizes their heart, their light
[4:55 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the people who wrote scripture had light, created light
[4:56 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: religions take that scripture and it gives them light, and light gives power and success
[4:56 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: that's what makes religions successful
[4:56 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: then the people are convinced that because the religion is evil, that the scriptures are also no good, 
this is another way that the religion takes even more light away from those people
[4:58 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: "You pore over the Scriptures because you presume that by them you possess eternal life. These are the very words that testify about Me, yet you refuse to come to Me to have life.â€¦" 
He had scripture without needing to write scripture, he had light, he had his eternal life
[5:00 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: "The [priests] and the scribes have taken the keys of knowledge and have hidden them. They did not go in, and those who wished to go in they did not allow. But you, be wise as serpents and innocent as doves."
[5:01 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the biggest lie that religion and the unconsciousness can convince people is that they have no light
[5:01 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: this may be an exchange, convince a person they have no light, you have just taken it from them 
[5:01 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but he said, "you are the light of the world"
[5:09 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Part of "seek and you will find" is a definite outcome, 
because if you seek, 
you will gain understanding, 
and understanding is connected to light. 
when you gain understanding, you gain light. 
when you share understanding, you share light. 
light and understanding are also related to wealth. 
understanding might actually bring you physical wealth, 
but the actual wealth is the light itself, 
when understanding touches you, it fulfills you, 
and we need some measure of this fulfillment in order to have the will to live
[5:10 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: we can gain small amounts of light from food, drink, conversation, experience, creation, 
we can take some small amounts of light from violence, destruction, 
fulfillment is a good indicator of light, 
satisfaction is a good indicator of light
[5:11 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: every time you feel that little light in you resonate in you, that's your soul eating food
[5:12 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: this is why anyone can gain light simply by reading scripture, even if they are completely evil they can still gain some sustenance from scripture because there is some amount of understanding in that scripture and they will gain some amount of understanding from consuming it
[5:13 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: and understanding and light are connected to love, 
because if you have enough understanding, you end up loving
[5:13 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: forgiveness, grace, mercy, compassion, they all require understanding

[5:17 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: i barely held on to my light to make it to this stage of life
[5:21 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: but it did unfold, and once i saw that it was not a product of my imagination, once i saw physical results in my real life, that was when i began to stop being so afraid i might be wrong, as i was able to test the results of days i poured out light and days i instead chose fear, self, 
i was able to see the changes over a span of time and the acceleration and momentum of outpouring that can happen, and then there were results beyond any expectation i might have ever had, 
to be honest with you i don't know if i had any expectation, 
I certainly did not expect fruit to bear in so many ways, 
and I did not anticipate gains such as respect and support and great value from others
[5:26 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: and with every word i write here, my inner critic condemns me for praising myself, by sounding delusional, because it's simply not rational to believe that tons of good can happen in life, 
maybe a little tiny good, but a lot of good? that's just not realistic in this world. 
that's just a bit too much. 
according to some, even if that were real, too much good simply inspires envy, hate, jealousy. 

but some gains, they can't be taken away, they happened, and so there is less fear that they can be taken away. 
then, the cost of me looking silly for speaking of great things is actually a far lower cost than the cost of me not speaking of great things, of not letting someone know that life can be amazing
[5:37 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: now I'm not saying my experience is completely amazing, I am filled with suffering and struggle and fight darkness, 
but I am saying that my external life is often amazing, that the out-pictured self to the world is often times unbelievable, the way my character has shown up in the external reality is unbelievable, to the point of unrecognition, to the point that I have often felt like there's been some sort of mistake, that I'm living the life of someone else, if I were to hit the brakes I would say, 'hold on, this isn't me, I'm broken", but when those moments start to become the life, there is no time to hit the brakes, and then you start to understand what a life of service really is, 
when you realize that being weak was comfortable, 
that resting into doubts and all the thoughts that you aren't good enough is actually a sort of escapism, 
and that the life of yourself and others is more important than retreating into those comforts, 
because you realize that it's far less painful to be weak and not able to do anything, 
it's far more painful to be strong and watch the consequences of your actions unfold, 
and this starts to hold you a bit accountable because you start to witness what happens when you decide to not be who someone needed, 
you witness what happens when you chose your lower self,  or even made the tiniest of selfish choices from that position, you begin to see that your actions have always been unbelievably consequential to this world, 
they always were, in every second interaction, 
you just didn't allow yourself to see it because it's quite painful
[5:40 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: you realize that to have real strength, is to pick up your cross and have real strength for others, 
and that this doesn't elevate you above everyone else like you think it might, 
you think that the leader is at the top, 
but you realize quickly that you are the servant, that you are below everyone else, that your strength is in service to them, 
and if you aren't in their service, that means there is something wrong

---

[5:49 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: the gain of light that sustains me in the external world, 
it's actually the light of others. 
Others give me their light. Their inner wealth, their appreciation, they give it to me, and it is greatly fulfilling. 
This is a secret. 
It is unlike spiritual robbery, I do not take it from them. 
They are reflecting back to me what I have given to them. 
I don't mean that I'm great and I have given them something, 
I mean that I have encouraged them, supported them, cheered them on, been the voice that is for them and not against them, 
and they have reflected that best part of themselves back at me, 
they have shown me their treasure, their treasure being the best part of them, 
people will love you for that. 

They will also hate you if you are the voice of reason that stands against them. 
No adult needs you to remind them of difficulty or caution. 
Their own mind can suffice enough for that voice of criticism.
[5:52 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I do feel like I should not speak of this because it makes me feel vulnerable and prideful and opens me up for attack on identity or perception, 
and I don't quite like openly reflecting on it, 
when I feel like it should be silent, or that the way I think about it is wrong. 
Maybe it is wrong for me to think too much about it and I need to learn to not create an internal story about this external experience.
