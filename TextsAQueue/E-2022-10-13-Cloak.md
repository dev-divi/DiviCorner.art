9 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I almost approached this day by gathering up all my creative energies, putting on my cloak, displaying the wolf and lion inside of me
[11:29 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I can compare the difference between this and the alternative
[11:31 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: To come in complete humility, to come as a lamb to slaughter, to come with nothing to prove, nothing to be,
This is the road less traveled by. 

It is only this option that the actual light of goodness might be honored and might descend onto me
[11:31 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I would never choose the second option myself
[11:32 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It is only in the face of a cost that is too great to take the chance
That this is the hand that I am forced to play
[11:34 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I'm not incidentally using the word cloak
[11:35 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: People talk about the armor of God as Ephesians
[11:35 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But I have found the cross reference in Isaiah
[11:35 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Which includes the missing cloak of zeal
[11:35 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on His head; 
He put on garments of vengeance and wrapped Himself in a cloak of zeal.
[11:36 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It's also worth noting that in Ephesians the one donning the armor might be a Christian Roman soldier, 
But the original context is that the main character here is God himself
[11:38 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: He saw that there was no man; He was amazed that there was no one to intercede. So His own arm brought salvation, and His own righteousness sustained Him. 
He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on His head; He put on garments of vengeance and wrapped Himself in a cloak of zeal.
[11:38 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: To me this describes a phenomenon, 
That in the darkest dark, 
man completely gives up, 
And God takes notice, 
And it is in that moment that he intercedes
[11:39 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I feel that it is then no coincidence that only a few moments ago I wrote about those two options that I had available
[11:42 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Note that I'm not talking "metaphorically"
[11:43 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: The god I am speaking from is a latent power within you, 
Almost as though it is a sleeping you that if only it would wake up, 
It could help you
[11:45 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And this cannot be mistaken with man's dormant powers within him, 
These are not powers of man. 
Man is infinite and powerful in many regards, 
But he is from the dust of this dimension 

The latent forces I speak of are not by the same laws of physics or rules or power levels or abilities
[11:46 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: In other words, man can achieve the impossible through sheer will

But this God can cause miracles, restructure reality, events, it could cause any possibility. It's a different level of outcome
[11:47 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: So to speak an outside intelligence that has better information than what is known by the consciousness
