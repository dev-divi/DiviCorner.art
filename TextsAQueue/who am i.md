Remembering what this society created me to be is exactly the person I became, how the information in this matrix is what created the person that now exists. 
A male individual who has played the best videogames watched the best media read the best books, had the best of education. 
All of that data exists within this person. 
And to look back and see that I had a great life in the dream. 
And to see the god force working in me, whether or not the god force is also part of the matrix. 

Is there a god in the matrix and a god outside of the matrix? 
What about the love inside me, from the other space, is that part of the matrix too? 

Coming to know myself not as a person, but as a consciousness, what an experience it is. 
There is a level beyond being a person, and to come to know myself as that being, this is what I really am, 
this is what humans really are, 
and it really is true that those who don't know themselves as beings are working to prevent anyone from knowing themselves. 

My person, my ego, its ambitions, its delusions, as a person, I cannot really stand what I am. 
If I attach myself to labels, I'm disconnected, alone, a freak, if I'm in a certain headspace. 
If I'm in another headspace, I'm in a world where I'm loved and people even look up to me. 
If I'm in another headspace, I'm in a world where people tolerate me, where I'm a complete stranger, 
and where their kindness has more to do with them having some decency rather than actually liking me. 

There's a journey of processing emotions that I'm on, and let's get real. There aren't empaths. There are those who don't have their emotional faculties active and aren't taking part in life. 

Who knows what I am really, whether I'm a loser, or a winner, or average. 
Who knows who I really am, not even myself. 
How can it be paradoxically be that the person who knows himself the most is the one who is the least understood. 

Why do I still participate in my own private hell where I believe that I am hated and despised, 
and why don't I respect myself and love myself in that.
