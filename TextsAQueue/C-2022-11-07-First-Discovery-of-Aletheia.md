[12:29 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Tonight I have stumbled upon the most important revelation of my life
[12:30 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: The confirmation that Jesus was an awakened consciousness
[12:30 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: That he saw what I see
[12:30 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And that he spoke of what's speak of
[12:30 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: As I always speak, 
that truth is reality, 
That man lives sleeping, that he isn't awake to reality
[12:31 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I have found that Jesus spoke of the same, but man mistranslated him
[12:33 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: So going back, to me retranslating the gospel of Matthew from my perspective of awakening, 
Then later wondering if I had been wrong in doing so, 
And now seeing that the actual translation is actually how I retranslated it naturally, 
Giving confirmation and validation to myself that my interpretation was not of an isolated delusion or deception,
but that I have the ear to hear.
[12:34 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: First, I will show the first verse I saw when I opened the bible as someone was praying for me
[12:34 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨:

"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 
Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you. 

For behold, days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will restore the fortunes of my people, 
Israel and Judah, says the Lord, and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers, 
and they shall take possession of it."

[12:35 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Next I was led to notice this verse
[12:41 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: 
'''"I still have much to tell you, but you cannot yet bear to hear it. 
However, when the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all truth. For He will not speak on His own, but He will speak what He hears, and He will declare to you what is to come."

..


But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. 
'''
[12:42 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I noticed the "spirit of truth" did not say "the Holy Spirit" so I looked into it and this is what I found
