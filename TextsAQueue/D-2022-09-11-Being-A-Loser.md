So on a related note to winning, 
Losing
None of my blessings of my gifts as a person are actually due to luck. 
They're due to choices. 

I have been a loser in this world because I have been unwilling to compromise my being for decades.
[8:09 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I am saying all of my blessings are related to an unwillingness to become normalized.
[8:10 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I have not been completely successful in this
[8:10 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I have lost 50-75% of my gifts at this time
[8:13 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: So what I'm saying it is, 
Is it's really not that you're this way or that way or great or small, 

It's a matter of what you want. What you want most is going to determine what parts of you are going to come out of you
[8:13 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: In my case I wanted to keep some of myself much more than I wanted to fit in
[8:14 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: So I kept myself and there were resulting consequences for that
[8:14 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And there were times I wanted to fit in more and I lost much of myself
[8:15 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: The good news is you can have whatever you want 
The bad news is you cannot have it all
[8:16 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But if you look at my life and what I wouldn't do
[8:16 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: You could see that I would probably have a lot of money if I had established myself as a freelance writer 
Or this or that trade
[8:17 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But in those futures I would not be experiencing some of the gifts I am getting now 

Gifts that you cannot buy
[8:18 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But it is also not the case that I just happened to get a bunch of rewards
[8:19 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Because the world did succeed in taking most of my gifts from me
[8:19 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: As it has taken from all of us
[8:19 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But it is not impossible to get them back
[8:19 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It is a lot of work
[8:19 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It takes a lot of reprioritizing and changing what is focused on
[8:20 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But it is not impossible to uncover your soul again
[8:20 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And life is trying in every possible way to help you recover your soul
[8:20 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Life is basically designed to reveal your soul
[8:21 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: This is the truth that I am not special 
I am not a spiritual prodigy 
I have no special talents
I have no hard skills 
I am not wise in my own right
[8:22 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I have only the fact that I am a seeker
[8:22 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: There is no special trick to this action
[8:23 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was not always wanting to help people
[8:23 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was not always focused on light
[8:24 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I have no special parts
[8:24 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: The one trick I've gained that's changed my life and my appreciation of it is that my presence is causing people to show me the beauty inside their hearts
[8:25 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: My heart is not more beautiful than another's, 
And there is no beauty as the human heart
[8:25 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And now the hearts of humans are revealing to me
[8:25 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: That's what I wanted most, apparently. 
Apparently that was the deepest desire of my heart.
[8:26 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: The one thing that changed my life was deciding to give a shit about myself before others
[8:28 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: As in I put myself before everything and everyone
[8:29 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I carved out the time for myself over every obligation
[8:29 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I changed my priorities and began to teach myself that I was the priority
[8:30 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Between my health or a job 
I began to choose my health 
Between my health or a partner 
I began to choose my health 
Between my health or money
I began to choose my health
[8:31 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: My priority became time
