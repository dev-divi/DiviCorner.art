Here is my translation of this verse as I interpret it, 

The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are [awake to goodness], your whole body will be full of light.
 But if your eyes are [asleep], your whole body will be full of darkness.
 If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! 
[9:12 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Then, if there is some sleepiness in me, some 'not fully awakeness', 
how great is the darkness in my interpretations
[9:14 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: If you can see the irony, 
I am writing about how one should not transliterate the scriptures from a partially unawakened state, 

While I speak from a partially unawakened state and then transcribe my own meaning to it lol
[9:14 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: My interpretation of awakening is multi-layered and talks about several things
[9:20 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: In one sense, I say this with experiential knowledge, 

If one is exposed to the light of awakening, 
A change will occur in their consciousness. 

In another sense, 
If I speak from pure truth, 
It is not me speaking. 
It is then a transmission from another source through me. 

If I speak as a person, I am speaking about truth from a limited cognition, limited context, and limited sense. 

In yet another sense, 
If you become real, if you awaken, 
You cannot ever unawaken.

In yet another sense, 
And perhaps the most important sense, 

Consciousness, 
An awakening, 
Is infinite. 
Light is infinite. 

If you are pure consciousness, 
You would disappear into the light. 
You would not be there. 
You would not have a name. 

Joe would not be awakened. 
There would only be awakened.
