My first spiritual plateau, once facing the mirror, there is not much more to face there, now my attention is faced at the world again. 

My deeds to me reveal a soul that cannot forget what it always knew and always protects what it holds valuable, and on the surface you could see a person who made choices like leaving jobs, non-commitance, but from a personal reflection, these choices honored and protected what the society wanted to take away. 

I also take comforts and blessing in those promises, 
And there are times I rest within an image that is not of me that is within wisdom and god and structure and strength, and this is a way to exist that I can rest in. 

But that is only one piece of my puzzle, because there is something that I can see.

What I see is that what is of god has value to us, like innocence. Then my society and culture systematically builds structure around that innocence. 
Now I have Christmas. As I am deeply bonded to Innocence, and Christmas has been bonded to Innocence, if you hurt Christmas, you hurt Innocence..you threaten and damage what is divine and sacred to me. 
This is how this world owns us. It uses what is sacred and combines it with a structure that we automatically protect. 
If you threaten the structure, you threaten the core in people's hearts, and you become an enemy.

I used to falsely identify as the bad guy in darkness, it's true. I don't anymore. I understand that my capacity for chaos does not mean I am called to needlessly destroy. 

I'm not talking about philosophical order and chaos. I'm talking about physical beliefs and structures.

But I do understand now that for other people, I am chaos. I have words and concepts and ideas that come from love, and these words hurt, because they damage and destroy the existing structures. This does not make me work with darkness.

The only darkness is being cast as the enemy when the words spoken destroy the existing frameworks. 
But I never fit in the existing frameworks because they were never meant to fit, they are scaffolding created by bad architects. 

But I am not saying that I take on some glorious cross to self sacrifice and be the enemy in order to move the world forward, 
I have no such commitment, 

It is only indirect. It is only indirectly that my words are seen as the enemy to the persons that rely on support structures to hold their faith, 
And I do not believe those structures are all **bad**, 

But rather that deeper understandings blow past those support structures and destroy them in the process. 

This destruction and chaos is not my fault, nor is it my role, 
but it is the consequence of speaking understanding. 

And then, in the classical sense, I really am the enemy of the system because the structures never fit me. They don't fit, they never fit. They can't. They are not my size. And so I can only look at them and glide near them or break them.

But this isn't really my problem. This is the world's problem. I don't choose to be or not choose to be an enemy, that judgement is passed this way from other than me. I'm the same uncontrollable personality I have always been, anyone can wrap any story that fits around it. 
That scaffolding is the house made of straw and if it happens to be in the path of my words then it will get destroyed. I didn't aim it at the scaffolding, it was just unfortunate enough to be present around those words. 

I realized much of this last night with a reflection as I watched Osho and he's wearing a black villainous robe and looking like Jafar from Aladdin and saying controversial statements like "There should be no religions", 
And then it hits me, he's my enemy. Culturally speaking, his words are threatening my culture, my belief systems, my structures. He is a devil. He wants to take away what I care about. 

And I saw that my words are often the same for other people. 
And looking on the surface of that man, you might say, okay, this man thinks he is god, he is a slave to his desires, a slave to his pride, his ego is on a high chair, he is deceiving people to get what he wants, and a possible extreme fear of abandonment out of the belief that he cannot be loved has caused him to operate in strange ways. 
Then when you hear his words you might say, this man is a devil. He wants to destroy society. He is causing chaos as a threat to our system, the devil is using him and giving him everything he wants in order to attack us. He is the false prophet. 

And in my conditioning, as soon as he says, "There is no God", my brain targets him and says, "Yep, right there in revelations, he's the false prophet, he's a fallen prince, he's even got the dark robes to match, that is the enemy". 
And then I can see this conditioning inside me that is protecting old, old structures I did not know were still there.  

And I know that I have said the same things as this man and I also understand what he means. 

And during this guys lectures, eventually his words reveal the fruit of his heart, eventually his deeper intentions are seen by me, 
When he defines love he has the capacity and understanding to describe the greater love, 
[He described Love as ["much like pain and suffering, but better"]
And from seeing this you can see that this man is not a slave to his desires, he is not a victim of his ego, he does not care about any of those things, he does not serve his own man, he is yet another servant of love and that is all he lives for, 

But we can wrap all of these stories around him, but he is operating from a place of love and going from there, 
And he is also hiding in great pain and suffering within love. He has the appreciation for his blessings and operating by certain principles he was taught or had found and that is it. There is no more [because these guys usually keep their thoughts and intentions pretty much clear and empty] 

And when you hear what they said about him, you can see that what they said was very very far away from him. He had nothing to do with anything they said. They didn't even know who they were dealing with. All the world knew was that there was a foreign threat, 
and they spoke not about him but their perceived threat, and they were not fighting him, 
they were fighting themselves. 
He was not even on the battlefield. 

And I can see that the deeper you go into serving love, the less discernable your ways and actions might be to the world around you, 
But it has nothing to do with you. 

Very often, a voice spoken is attacked because it's what everyone was thinking deep within their heart and did not currently have the capacity to acknowledge their own facts.
