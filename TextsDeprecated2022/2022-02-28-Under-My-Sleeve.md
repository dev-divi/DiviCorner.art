And I cannot believe rumbling under my sleeve is a great creator, 
much like the Great Creator, and lesser me, in all my perfectionate Abysmalic ignorances, 
in my percentile plays, my calculatorous statements in great glorification that I am who I said I am 
and look, there I was, the whole time, 

have some **new** observation, open your mind, 
"No, no, it's not quite like that, you're slightly off." 
No, no. It is quite like that. You're simply stuck.
The fear of forgetting has made you forget that it was never one way 

and I change what I say 
    I never change 
    I change what I portray
