True: _"I just understood why information doesn't stick with me. 
One of these temporary parts for most of us is the logic or analytical mind
I'm so focused on this faculty that retaining becomes hard
"I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.‚Äù
This was my inspiration for what I wrote. <!-- I saw it on sorcerawr --> 
Training your analytical and logic doesn't require a lot of memory, 
it's like a machine learning architecture where you train with data, then can forget the data itself. 
Take a simple AI that tries and guess a next number from the sequence. 
First you would need a list of numbers, then you would sum it up and divide by the total amount of numbers to get the average. 
Once this is done, you don't need to remember the each numbers, only the total amount of numbers and the sum of them._

_I'm inclined to believe that our rational side tends to operate in a similar fashion.
So if you are concerned with the rational analytical and logical faculty,  
remembering raw data becomes cumbersome because you are not acclimated to such task."_

Yeah that is on point. Our processes and subprocesses are very similar to machine learning and how we can reprogram the mind.
This concept of temporal even applies to these conceptual scaffolds. 
These scaffolds, the results in your analogy, are the bulk of what we create in the mind. 
There are some of these conceptual structures that have a permanence, and others that will break like a glass castle too. 

There is probably a different issue though as to why you are not retaining information, 
this is that we expand and contract. 
You are probably filling your head with information during both states and there is just a consistent overflow and
lots of information just is not getting processed. I am pretty certain I did this for many years. 
There might be periods where it is okay to do this, if the information mostly sucks and you really do have to parse tons of it
to get anything out, I remember some times like that. 
In remembering that life is moderation, you drink in some data during the absorption state, the expansion state, 
and then you process that data in the contraction state when you shrink into yourself. 
There is a dance and a sweet spot to hit where you are drinking just enough information to be comfortably growing and processing. 

The pressure to want to be fixed or figure it all out unfortunately harms that growth, 
that self imposed pressure and stress makes it difficult to flow in this dance.
The escapism into mass media can hurt this dance also.
