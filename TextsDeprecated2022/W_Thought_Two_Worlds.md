The thought passes by me as I am reflecting on buddhism, I am scanning a Vedas text,   
and I thinking that  
like man and woman are separate and marry,  

The world is split in two and I am on one side, my whole life has grown on one side  
And perhaps my bride is the other side.  

Seconds after this thought, I see this line, "The two world-halves, the spirited, the beautiful, because the Father hath clothed them in godly forms."
