For the first time I think goes too far out for what this world is ready for, what it wasn't ready for 2000 years ago either. 

Right now it seems that what the world needs is Christ's light to mature the soul, 

And my own understandings of spiritual law have allowed me to see how powerful people have leveraged it fairly to pursue their goals and achieve the impossible, men we will never know, 
But these men are indifferent to us, 

And it has been revealed to me where god's heart is pointed, that just as Satan targets the biggest fish, 
God is also targeting the biggest fish, the fish is these powerful anonymous operators that think indifferently of their fellow man. 
All of the oppression mankind will go through as man reaches higher to evolve himself, and enslaves populations for his goals, this is all so that God can forgive man who feels indifferently about his fellow man. It's all just a stage to target that that's the heart of humanity, that's the lowest vibration that must be risen. 

I do not know this other yet but in knowing what is necessary to know in order to operate how they are operating, I can imagine that they have developed an ideology that they are justified in indirectly or directly driving the world into further ignorance, as they gain further understanding, as justified that ignorance breeds ignorance, and the fault does not lay on them, but the ignorant.
I realized many years ago that the violent voice that says "I hate God" does not mean "I hate God." What it really means is "I hate Man. I hate that man was wrong and lacking in understanding and hurt what was sacred and should not have been hurt. 
I want to destroy that which hurt me." And I have witnessed the spirit of violence hiding in the hearts of the sensitive loving artist types. I can see that God's hand, his play, his chess move, is targeting these types, 
In order to get them to forgive the people system that is systematically designed to strip them of all of their power and take everything from them. 
The heart of the artists has to change to forgive the matrix in order to move forward. 

 And I know this sounds like just what people say but I mean this literally that I am now considering that every single thought pattern in this world is a trap to keep us from not thinking.

That all of the thoughts from our world that are repeated are one distraction.
The thoughts say things about our experience, our spiritual lives, our meaning, they highlight parts of this whole thing, 
But even though the reference a thought may be pointing to is real, the thought is still using the subject as a tool for distraction. 

Because the world would operate differently if we were just here. Without belief systems we would be operating in massive power and faith and working directly with god, I think we are systematically operating at 1%, which is what makes people so angry at the system when they break out of it. 

But these thoughts have us dancing hypnotic tunes that keep us from being okay and existing right now and becoming the Mover instead of the moved.
