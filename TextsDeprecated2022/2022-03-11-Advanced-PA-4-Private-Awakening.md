I am trying to wrap an entire nonlinear world here so here we go 

There are choices that I will explain but I believe are fully dependent on me coming to understand what my understander understands, 
a dis-identification with the thinking mind, which I am now thinking of as a sort of obsessive fixation that is culturally reinforced, a collective encouraged delusion, 
As to what I've always known, that humanity is one entity, only as divided as its own mind, not unlike a supercomputer, 
this is nice conceptually and theoretically but to know it and understand it is different, 

I believe this may be a key to unlocking a state of consciousness, a level of awareness and understanding, that it is this key that keeps people locked out from the empathetic awareness and faculties. To the single mind the rest of this is impossible. My consciousness highlights this simple phrase as the necessary key, "There are no borders." As long as there is division, the mind cannot get to these faculties. 

But once this has been glimpsed, there was something else that I couldn't see yet, that everything in my ego is the perfect reflection of my world. Not almost perfect, it is a perfect exact reflection. This understanding comes later. 

But I think with the fixation of ego believing it is ego, it cannot die. It will never let itself die, the thinking mind will never let itself be, it just can't. If it falls into the silence, it will freak out from the call to exist. Even if the mind knows that the real self is really Spirit, asking it to die is still just far beyond what it is a reasonable request it seems. 
But when this has been glimpsed, like the possibility of self sacrifice, the being and the ego can be softened into releasing the fixation on the person. 

Then there's the actual practices, and I have a few years focused on Presence meditation, and I have figured out how to send a certain energy out and towards myself that can make my energy start to radiate and be more receptive, and this is extremely pleasant, my absolute favorite, and usually what my self would want all the time, and what I have identified is in in group meditations, usually just one person is radiating the Presence and everyone else is trying to do it but really they're just borrowing some of the leader's presence. 

Now from that place of presence it's pretty close to the present moment and that access to the kingdom of heaven is usually right nearby. 
But Presence is not the whole thing, not to me. In my mind, that's all I want. But there's more than just that. 

There's a real me, not my essence, and I have finally been able to see this self in clarity, it is the voice of my knower, and it speaks in the same way always, but I didn't really see where it was until recently when I saw it spoke out of other men and said the same words and highlighted to their consciousnesses the same verses, and gave them the same meanings to those verses, 
And stumbling upon their "understandings" a few years after having them, with myself and those others, I can use our positions to metaphorically triangulate the position of this voice, far far away from their egos and my ego, and I can see that this voice is so far out in space that you cannot bring your self with it, 
You can not bring your good or bad intentions and desires and pride and beliefs with it, the lake is too deep, those things float they can't go down there. 

But accessing a level of stillness I already have some practice with, the free writing allows me to empty my head of thought and observe them and see that I am the listener of the thoughts. 
 
There are only two more concepts that brings me here, 

The first is back to presence,
A method used to access presence by acting as the compassionate witness, 
Most of the major soulical alchemy I've done in my life and major healing I have done in my life has required this, 
the practice of settling the attention on emotion as observation [perhaps with curiosity or wonder] and watching it until it transforms and moves, 
And I see this practice like looking at the clouds and watching them disapate, the same is true for shining the light on dark spirits. 

And people usually say this practice is sitting with life as it is,
And that can open up a nice awareness and also provide another door to the present moment    

And then lastly is "I will not want". That's the last key I needed.

  And then I saw this statement 

The riddle, the claim that "being" or whatever you have it is a door that is right there at all times right now from my present moment. 

And so I asked what is always here that never changes for me. Everything on this plane changes for me, my experience of reality, my mind my thoughts my heart my soul, my outside world the emotions that surface it all changes, there is nothing here that is available *at all times*, maybe a lot of the time, but not at all times. 

 Now a secret personal trick of mine for radiating is looking at the mirror and giving my image and self eye contact and a few kind words for 30 seconds or so.  

But as for this riddle, I remembered that I once [or a few times] put my face up close to the mirror. A centimeter from it. And up this close, what I see is not one of the many pictures of my person I have seen. Instead is a creature, an alien, a husk, ugly and grotesque, almost like a planet in outer space, a giant with these eyeballs that do not register in any way that I am thinking. In them is no proof of conscious life. 
This is an other. I don't know this being, I have never met this being, I don't know where it comes from, I don't know what it is, I know nothing about it. 
I not only know nothing about it but inside its eyes is the universe, and I know nothing about that either. This vessel shows me nothing. 

And here is the intense anxiety and fear. The possibility that I have no idea what's going on, there's a terrifying unknown being in front of me, 
And the most terrifying part of all, 
There is no association of any kind to it. My ego cannot fixate on this. My ego can't pretend that it is this husk, there is 0 connection between the awareness observing this vessel, and the vessel. That face is as much me, as I am a rock in the middle of the milky way. 

And I realize that this is the answer to my riddle. This uncontainable, unhandleable, overwhelming anxiety is what's always here, 

And it's not just always here but I can always access it, 
It's always been here, at every moment, at every moment I have either avoided it or been within an experience intense enough to forget about it. 

And I fathom that here it is, the door to just being. To finally just being. 
And I was right. 

 When I rest my attention on this overwhelming feeling, it is so overwhelming that 100% of my focused conscious attention is on it, there is no self or ego in me, and then I can look back and be fully present with others. 

Because where my mind is resting, the ego is not  available, it is not a place where the ego is, all of the thoughts and beliefs of the person are back where I left them. 
And then why people would choose this becomes clear, 

You can be 100 times more present and attentive to others from this place. 

And then what I had heard a lot of people said made sense, they said they operated as the "mirror", the perfect mirror, 
and now I see that this is what they meant.

When the ego is not interfering, you can be 100% present for another person, find your love for them, and just be that. You can let god speak through you to them 100% with no issue. 

 Because I don't have any desires in that space, there is no self to have desires and motivations,  not even good motivations. And yet I can still be conscious and have even more understanding than I would than if I used my mind 

 And then you can see the ego as this sort of sick toxic victimized poor me machine that is just cyclically trying to find ways to validate its own existence 

It can't help itself for being exactly what it is. 

But anyway this is the doing and the action is it's ultimately choosing to go into what is unpleasant and that which we avoid. 
And from the different angle, the uncomfortability, the not accepting right now, is the barrier between life as it actually is in the present moment, 
And our dissatisfaction with life as we think it should be, unable to be with it as it is with a "rational" mind. 

Right past that uncomfortability, is not just a temporary state of spiritual light or radiant presence, or a high, 
It's absolute perfection and beauty and being because it's the fullness of the whole perfect thing. It's not a heightened experience, 
It is the real experience.

And with that is the man in gods Image in the context of my creative forces and powers are made fully available 

 The choice is basically the knowing that I can't help someone more than being present for them, 
The knowing that I don't need to be anything for them, 
And that there is nothing to do, 
I don't need to be present for them, 
But in seeing the relative value of this option, the maximum impact, such an offering to be there for other is l I t e r a l l y a no-brainer. 

I don't need to be the self to operate, 
nothing has changed except I can have greater presence and my experience has changed. 
The ego can still play out the life and I can still do whatever I do.
