We forgive because we know the monster inside 
We forgive because we are not saved until every one of us is saved. 
We forgive because this is the alchemical magic 
We forgive because we are not of this world. 

We forgive to honor our own selves 
We forgive in order to access the flow of grace 

We forgive because we forgive 
We forgive because we were once forgiven 
We have once been shown mercy, grace, kindness, 

We forgive because we understand 
We forgive what we do not understand 

We forgive what requires love 
We forgive as love forgives 

We honor and respect the divine, even as it exhibits dis-ease, that the divine might come back to ease, 
that we may come back to ease 

We forgive because we bring gifts of mercy and care 
We bring supplies to the battlefront, we offer, 
we give no orders to the soldiers in dismay, 

We forgive that they might face their own reflection, confront themselves, 
face the mirror of their own deeds, 
allowing justice to serve itself in perfection, 
allowing the possibility of change.
