I havent dealt with the feeling of dread that I need to do something that matters 

that feeling

that i need to embrace 

is the exact feeling that I should stop sit with and alchemize 

i can do that now

Every experience of fear and anxiety, and negative states is an opportunity to absorb that energy and transmute it. When I feel fear, I should absorb it.
