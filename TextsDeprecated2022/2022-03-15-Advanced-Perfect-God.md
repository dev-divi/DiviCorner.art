I love God, don't you? He's perfect for me. 
I blame him for everything wrong, 
praise him for everything right, 
what an idea, always there, 
whatever I need him to be, 
whatever I want him to be, 
in my image, God, 
my perfect tormentor and greatest friend, 
Oh God of my rationality, thank you for taking it all on for me, 
you know I don't want to blame them, and yes, 
you know someday I must admit, that your many parts love many things, 
and someday I might acknowledge, 
that the same god who got some cheap thrills out of torturing a few billion souls in fun ways, yes of course I understand you, yes of course I've been bored too, divine sadomasochist, hurting yourself and Divine Mother just to craft the emotional delicacy, 
just to feel it all, 
every feeling, 
all the way, 
anything less is not enough, 
oh yes I understand you, I'm the same way, 
I hold on to all the feelings and feel them all, I love them all too, so how could I judge you? 

Monster and savior by design, who could blame you for being exactly what you are, you can't be anyone else, and you suffered for me! 
And I suffer, for you! 

How could one think such apalling things to the Great Creator, 
and yet, and yet, appalling as it may be, 
god has his devil just as we, 
the not thinking part is a monsterly design, 
it has no reference point to should or should not, 
the only should is pleasure, 
and all is pleasant to it, God on his throne is the same god who wants it all, the other side of his duality, the consequence to his perfection, and he understands this is perfect, 
he takes no offence to truth, he never did, the only one offended by god's evil is a little man and angry thoughts, angered by truth always known and constantly denied, 
that his maker loves suffering as much as he loves healing, 
that on his maker's domain there is only good, 
but to point fingers at god, as we once did bitterly and silently, how could we do such a thing? 
To call the same one that has the lamb of innocence as the same one that takes away our children and allows our pain, yes, this one and the same, the great I am, 
the reflection of man, 
but it is only man who takes offence. 
The Lord is undisturbed, sleeping soundly each night, 
knowing the all of the all, 
free from the duality and torment of human minds, 
the real God, the great Other, 
the other side, the one we do not know, the one who may not know himself, 
that he uses us to see himself in his fullness, 
we are his body, we are his observational mind, 
that we might know him, 
he who has always been.
