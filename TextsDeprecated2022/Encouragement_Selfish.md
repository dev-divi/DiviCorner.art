I am so sorry that they called you selfish.  
Will you please forgive them someday,  
when you can?  
Envy and Jealousy create a recipe and we fall in the way.  
You in challenging have shifted the balance towards how we ought to live,  
You with the Strength and Courage to stop and consider the course.
