I do not know exactly what constitutes the river but I know a lot of variables when I had encountered it: 

- I had fallen lower than low, rock bottom and had kept falling from there 
- I had a turning point where I had chosen to be thankful for life to god, when I saw a coworker see the beauty in the stars and be grateful for life itself 
- I had some level of appreciation for my life as it was, not as I wanted it to be 
- I had experience with mindfulness and had neared a point where positive thoughts started to dominate my waking consciousness over negative thoughts 
- I had been exposed to Alan Watts and some new age 
- I had developed a willingness to surrender [ potentially the most important / only important variable ]
- I had found an interest in turning my massive ego towards a pride in playing 'hero' by serving others in my job [ in which 'hero' felt like pure vanity and complete self delusion of false importance but was still a high ]
- I was participating in my life and allowing it to unfold a bit, and had a willingness to leap at the time. 
- I had encountered people that introduced me to concepts and ideas that seem to have brought me into flow state. 

I theorize that the occultist concept that you cannot read about magic and gain access to its power, the words are alive,
and you must have a teacher carrying the living words in order to transfer, literally, transfer 
the meaning to you, with themselves as an actual conduit of this power, I theorize that this concept could be true of gaining
access to the awareness of this flow state. 

I theorize that it is possible that you must encounter someone carrying the awareness of the flow state, whom can transfer living idea to you. 

That the information in books may be dead, without the active energy of the ideas, 
without the ideas being true in existence right now in the moment. 

To access certain states I theorize that you must have information transferred to you that is true right now, 
not information that was true five minutes ago. 

However I believe this is remedied by the choice to participate in life and receive life, to allow life to come to you. 

Technically speaking, it always starts with you, not other. 
The most important variable could be exploring you in the present moment, 
as opposed to reading the dead words and concepts of others. 

It is very possible that my words right now are dead, echoes of memories that have passed, not carrying an energy to transfer understanding / concepts. 

However, in the present moment between two people I believe it should be possible to encounter a flow state in the now based on the subject of conversation, 
now that I have encountered this phenomenon of significantly expanded awareness and life several times. 

This has usually been in spoken, audible conversations as far as I can remember. 
The necessary conduit to transfer energy is likely in the voice, 
in the sound of the voice that transfers the data, and that sound has to be new. 

True: _"Then there's a distinction to be made, because energy can take many forms. It is converted through many mediums. Perhaps there's different types of energy.."_
