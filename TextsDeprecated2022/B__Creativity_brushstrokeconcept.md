A piece of art is created from the imagination. Its result is either miraculous, beyond the realm of what man is believed to be capable of,
or underwhelming, it does not live up to expectation.

If it turns out exactly how it is expected, if the art is of a certainty, than the art in question may be something that can be easily copied and replicated by anyone.
For the work that is uncertain, there is only miraculous success or a result that is not the perfection of its original concept. Only the artist themselves perhaps knows which of these the work is.
I have identified that the methods that determine these results simple, and I will not stretch this out into an entire book to explain this.

Process A  
Forming a picture in the imagination and attempting to create what is seen in the real world.

Process B  
Creating with the imagination in real time.

In practice these processes are obvious, but the why is not obvious.  
The hidden difference is simple.  

In Process A,  
Man creates or a vision in his mind. He now picks up his pen to create it on paper. He will not be creating it for the first time. He already created it for the first time in his mind. Now he is attempting to create a copy. The copy will not be the same.

In Process B,  
Man has no vision in mind. He may have a concept in mind, an idea, but he does not know what the creation will look like. He might know what its type is, but he has not seen it, it has never existed.  

Just one additional difference to pay attention to is that in process A is an expectation of result. Process B must have no expectation, there is no room for expectation as one is inside their creative channel in the moment and participating with the stroke of the brush. Their expectation is already being fulfilled in the act of creation itself. The result could be nothing less than the full power of the thought of the imagination and the current skill level of the artist.  

This concept affirms a basic principle that there cannot be two copies of a masterwork. There is only one vision to be created. The realized idea is as perfect as the imagination intended it to be. If this were a stroke of genius, the result will be genius. If this were a stroke of madness, the result will be madness. A variation of process B is the only method to access the full realization of an idea brought into tangible form.  

I call this the Brush Stroke method because I am reminded of the first scripture in Genesis.   
“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” — Genesis 1:1  
In contrast, in all later scriptures God spoke, “Let There Be [X]”.  
In this narrative, there was first one voiceless thought that resounded outwards to create the heavens and earth. There is no premeditation, no planning, no even an audible voice mentioned here, only the silent sound of a consciousness illuminating a non-existence into existence. One thought, one singular breath. This is a Single Brush Stroke.  
According to the awake and aware, we are still within that first breath of consciousness, and our original thought — brought into a brush stroke into our art — is a continuation of the larger brush stroke, and could not be other than the perfection of the original Sound, the Breath.  

At the time of this writing this should be taken as a theoretical, though I have evidenced this myself, I have not had the exposure to this experience necessary to understand it farther.
