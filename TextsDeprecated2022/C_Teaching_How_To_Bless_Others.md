When you try to teach others what you're learning right now,  
it's kind of like stabbing yourself a bit, it only hurts a bit and makes you feel more alone  

Scripture says we should not try to teach our elders, its not our job  

and outside of scripture,  
it injures the elder mans pride and ego if you prove him wrong, it weakens his confidence and stability and structure,  
because you are within his structure, and now you are attacking the structure from the inside  

Just because it is wise to listen to younger people,   
Does not mean you need to teach your elder the benefit of listening to younger people  

It takes a while to accept but you ought not to try to help people who do not want help  

you'll see lots of people that dont know things that if they did their lives would be easier   
but it is not a teachers job to tell people what they are not looking to learn

what I've learned works terrifyingly quickly, is instead of telling a person what you want them to learn,  
just bless them to find that understanding and learn it in their own way and in a way they can access 

and you will be shocked at how quickly the person comes to you to tell you of their new realization   

when it comes to others learning everything, turning out that just blessing them to find the understanding is the most effective 

it is better to focus on your own learning than the learning of others  

and more importantly, if you've been studying wisdom  

then you know that people come to talk to the person who is reserved with their words and does not shout out all of the answers  

by actually being more quiet and secretive,  

you encourage others to come to you to access your knowledge banks  

by telling everyone what you think, they will not hear you  

*"blessing them face to face?
or in the form of a prayer"*

in the form of prayer  

silent wishes  

with good intent  

the intent is the important part, you are wishing them well because you care about them  
and because you dont want them to suffer  

those are good intentions  

you can have confidence and some righteousness  
in that caring



notice how the pride in the confidence and righteousness is not in the man  

but in the knowing and seeing and acknowledging that there is caring that is real  

and this caring does not really come from the man,  

it is a depth you have to focus on for it to even be noticed  

in this way it cannot be attacked  

and your credibility for your wish cannot be attacked
