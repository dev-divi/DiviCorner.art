We once knew we were perfect love, 

but we found pain, 

We found fear upon approaching that pain 

We found powerlessness upon approaching our fear 

We found comfort in joining the powerless around us 

-

We knew that we were perfect love, 

but it wasn't relevant to the current situation, 

not while I was powerless, 

he said to me I was nothing, just like him, 

he had a sword, and I was tired and ill, 

and it did not matter what I said, 

I said "Yes", I agreed, 

there was no point in fighting him, 

when I knew deep down, 

but over time, 

I thought like him, 

I started to forget 

-

And sometimes I remember, 

but most of the time, 

I am swept away into a colorful party of night.
