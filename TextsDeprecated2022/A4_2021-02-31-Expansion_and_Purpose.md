True: _"Is it possible that you enter expansive state by getting closer to your purpose? 
Don't remember the exact Alchemist quote, but as you get closer you feel exhilaration."_ 

Is it possible that purpose could lead you closer to the expansion state? Possible. 
Will the purpose described in the Alchemist will lead you toward the expansive state? Nah, I do not believe so. 

The purpose described in that book, aligned with the heart, is a parallel path, this is the heart of the artist. 
The exhilaration mentioned is part of that journey. 

There might be some fulfillment found on that path, but this is not enough to be a sustainable raison d'etre, a reason for being. 
The heart cannot be your sole purpose, your only investment, because you have no guarantee that the heart will stay with you. 
As Jaskier noted in The Witcher, "My biggest fear is what I will do if the muses stop speaking to me." and concludes 
that if that happened, a new purpose would have to be found, there is no other option. 

The artist's spark, the creative light, is not consistent enough for anyone, even those who have a lot of access to it,
to be enough on its own. That is a gift that appears and disappears, not an identity to ground on. 

As for the expansion state, 
We still have thinking that life has a solution. The expansion state is not a solution.
Life is actually more like a trap in which we are caught between swinging [hopefully not violently] from that expansion to contraction. 
But there is a "state" in which we align with a rhythym between these states in a way that is amazing. 

This is the flow, the river of life. In our world pretty all of us [as far as I am aware] got swept off to the side of the river. 
When you are in the river, you know it, because expansion is rapid, learning is rapid, there is eternal newness, eternal life every moment. 
Your emotional growth becomes rapid [the grinch's heart grew 3 sizes that day] in the expansion state, 
and the contraction state is full of change.
