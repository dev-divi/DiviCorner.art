This is the original full copy of the Servant of Love text. 


I just read Jesus talking to the Samaritan woman and I've glimpsed an entirely different possibility of world events, 

Jesus spoke words that those with understanding know and the masses do not know, 
What if Jesus came into the world at a time that spiritual desperation had hit the Jews,
being oppressed by new systems of control at the end of an era, 
 ripening them to a state in which they are ready for change.

We know the world hated the Jews during these times because they treated everyone terribly and accepted no one and judged everyone and were prideful, they were the farthest people from god. 

And there is a principle that to change humanity you have to help the one who needs help the most, raise the lowest vibration. 

So it would seem that Jesus came to the Jews [and the masses]  to give them understanding that others already possessed at the exact time that the people were ripened and ready for change. 

"I did not come to save the healthy, but the sick" could be a double meaning, not just referencing his purpose and mission, 
But also referencing his physical target audience. 
He could have targeted other nationalities that would have welcomed and accepted him with open arms. 


I feel that the Samaritan woman he meets on the road is of his own kind, that he speaks with her not because he is increasing his sphere of influence, but that he is talking to her woke person to woke person, 
And saying words that she is at a level at which she should be able to understand, 

"If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, â€˜Give me a drink" 

I see a two part conditional statement,
1. If you know the gift 
2. Who it is who speaks to you 

As being words this woman can someday understand, and both conditional statements go together, one condition is dependent on the next, 

If you knew the gift of God IS love, 
And you know the gift, 
Then you would know you are the gift, we are of love, and you would know what the gift is, you would know the gift. 

And you would also know who it is who speaks to you, because who it is who speaks to you is the gift of God. 

In his second statement, 
"you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."

I see this as interaction is as follows, 
1. Jesus and the woman sense each other are kindred spirits, 
2. Jesus makes the connection and wishes to see if she is awake as he thinks she might be, 
Asking her for a drink, 

If she is awake in love, if she knows the way of love, she will hand him the drink without question, love does not question. Love only serves. 

I think then the statement is actually intended to mean,  ["had you known the gift of God, you would have asked to serve me, and I would have given you living water."] 
It seems the word serve is missing here. 
He asked for water, had she known love, she would have asked to serve him water. 

She does not give him the drink, which tells him everything he currently needs to know about her, she is not a servant of love. 

Being a servant of love was not a new concept, the fact that the imposed "serve" is missing and the meaning is lost, makes me feel that someone knew the concept of being a servant of love, and did not want that concept extrapolated from this conversation. 

This transaction would have honored the laws, 
Had she asked to serve him water, thereby giving him water, she would have received love, 
Because she had demonstrated an act of love that living water of love would have been returned to her. 

But she does not give him the drink, and I think in his answer, "and who it is that asks you for a drink", while confirming she did not return the exchange, he is not just telling her off but also probing her for one last opportunity to see if she can return the exchange.

She shortly later identifies him the Christ, and he fills that role. 

This has made me stumble onto a thought, 
Love fills whatever is needed and asked for, 

The world called and asked for the Christ, perfect love became what the world asked for. 
The world had heard words about love before but it was not listening for it or asking for it. 

But once the world begins asking for the Christ, now it is asking for the words it is now ready for.
The words are only new to the Jews, who had hardened their hearts to understanding, 
but now at this point of ripened maturity where they want it. 
There is nothing new under the sun, the change wasn't just Christ coming but the state of humanity becoming ripe and desperate enough to ask to receive understanding. 
Now Christ is telling them the words their neighbors have shouted at them, the difference is they are listening, their hearts are open to receive the Christ, the messiah. 
Before they were not asking for a Messiah, but when they ask for it, he appeared.
