Thich Nhat Hanh, Plum Village 

"  
We walk and we don't know that we are walking   
We are there but we do not know that we are there   
We are alive but we do not know that we are alive   
We are losing ourselves    
We are not ourselves    
And that is happening   
Almost all, all day long, long   

So the act of sitting down is an act of revolution    
You sit down and you cut off    
You stop that state of being     
Losing yourself    
Not being yourself    
And when you sit down,     
you connect to yourself    
and you don't need an iPhone or a computer to do that    

You just need to sit down mindfully and breathe in mindfully,    
and in a few seconds,     
you connect with yourself,    
you know what is going on,    
what is going on in your body,    
what is going on in your feelings,   
and your emotions,  
what is going on in your perceptions, and so on  

You are already home and to take care of home, you have left home for a long time,   
and home has become a mess   
So going home means to sit down and be with yourself and connect with yourself   
And accept the situation as it is,  
It is a mess yes but I accept it 
..  
So now that I am home I will rearrange everything..   
 And I will tidy up my home    
..
[with mindful breath] we connect with our feelings    
we say don't worry, I'm home, I have take care of you    
And you embrace your feeling with tenderness..     
whether it is fear or anger or loneliness    
and warm up ourselves with that kind of practice    
..
And when you have a true home you have happiness, you have safety, you have fulfillment,   
and then you are in a condition to go to the other, an individual or society."* </i>  

See the rest of the lecture in the video for the method of dealing with the loneliness,  
and with establishing real connection to others."
