Depression is the result of believing in powerlessness. If you feel that you cannot control your world and you cannot do anything to change your circumstances, if you are life's victim, you will experience depression.  
When you feel like you have some power and ability to make moves, most of depression runs away  

The depression isn't exactly from powerlessness it's from placing faith in the belief of powerlessness  
and it is often more comforting to believe that we are powerless than it is to think that we might be able to do something  
one is not risky at all, the other is risky and shakes the boat.
