What an interesting experience, this different perception of what I could make. 
I feel inspired by looking at the website of another, and have always marveled at the confidence exuded 
by some. 
Now I have caught a taste of their spark and I see, when you share something amazing, when you know what you are creating, what is amazing is amazing! There is a place without fear here, in perfect creation. 
I have fought and gone far to have this level of simple enjoyment of the words I like listening to the sweet sound of. I cannot help but recognize that I am a curator, a cultivator or pleasant words, and I love this. 

I can enjoy this without judgement because the words I like have nothing to do with me, just as one does not create the seashells they collect on the seashore.
