Prepare as you would for Meditation 
Select music for your journey if guided. 
Find a quiet place free of distractions 
Adjust the lighting and room temperature 
Adjust clothing . . . footwear . . . eyeglasses 
Sit down or lie down 
Find a position that is comfortable for you. 


Quiet your mind 
Still your thoughts 
Relax your body 

Your face . . . your jaw . . . relaxing 
Your shoulders . . . your neck . . . relaxed 
Your arms . . . your hands . . . feel at peace 
Your torso . . . your hips . . . letting go 
Your legs . . . your feet . . . totally relaxed. 

Focus on your breathing 
Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose 
Retain the breath as long as is comfortable 
Exhale through the mouth slowly and completely 
Repeat for two more breaths - or as is comfortable. 

Close your eyes 
Allow you mind to wander. 

You see before you a cave. 
You walk closer to have a better look 
You look on in amazement as the cave fills with the 
golden light of the sacred creational flame. 

As with the Violet Flame 
a ray of this creational light source 
you have been guided here today 
to join with its energies and 
and experience the 'flow of creation'. . . 
which is just below you as you enter the cave. 

Slowly you move into the Cave of Fire 
You notice that its energies are not hot 
but soothing as you continue along 
towards the far end of the cave 
the Source of the flame. 

Allow your body to connect with the light 
As it does it 'burns off' old 'karmic ties' 
You stop to see what you must let go  
as you pass through each flame / ray.

As you move forward you sense 
your physical body becoming lighter 
your frequency escalating exponentially. 

Continue on receiving messages as you go.  
See them on the screen behind your eyes 
Listen to the thoughts in your mind 
Become One with the Flame 

When you reach the end of the cave 
you understand that you are the flame 

you can create 
You know how to let go of that which binds you  
Your soul is free!
