Breath and Time the natural clock 
Oh! Time speeds up and slows down relative to me, 
Man's clock ticks but cannot change velocity, 
but look at me, my program, as designed, 
a well oiled machine too, in rhythyms, in instruments,  
see it now, my ticks, 
my system measuring the speed of my time and counting, 
organically, keeping track for me, 
knowing when my flower is ready to blossom into Death, 

Ceaseless, Definitive, Absolute, Unfailing, 
back to 0 again, allowing for the temporary deviation,
aligning back into greater time, too fast will become too slow to make the difference
and with this function I am Complete, a Complete Vessel, Per Specification,
unfathomable perfection, by way beyond mortals, the support systems running in the Realm of Magics
