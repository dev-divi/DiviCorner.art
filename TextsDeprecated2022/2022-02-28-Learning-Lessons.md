Do I learn my lessons? Do I face them enough? 
Is poor the place I am subjected to them? 
Is poor the place I am subjected to them? 
No, poor is a direct result of inconsistency in long term confidence and for whatever is said, 

the truth is you protect your heart first, don't you? 
That the only entity that steals, destroys your spark is **you**, my soul to break, my reasons to know, surrendering to life, completely in flow 

Here I am Lord, sing me a song, a lullaby, calm my heart and ears
