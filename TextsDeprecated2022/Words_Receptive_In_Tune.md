More Receptive More in Tunee    

More Aligned with the Divine Song 

and more in the somethings we find we possessed all along as 

I hear the stillness and

Feel the Silence as I

Ponder the Pond 

and Dance in the River 

Splash on their anger 

Hot Mist 

Soothing Coal 

Machinations 

Washing out the infestations 

That looks infected sir 

Let it go 

You became the healer now in your whole soul.
