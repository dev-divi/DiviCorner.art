Robert Greene's Creative Pitfall Synopsis I stole from a website:  

Complacency: we take everything for granted and feel like we know everything 

Conservatism: we stick to what worked in the past and we want to fit in. But if we worry about failure and what others think we’ll never do anything creative (also check Linchpin on the fear of showing your work) 

Dependency: you have to distance yourself from your own work and art so that you can discern helpful feedback from useless hatred 

Impatience: the creative process requires constant focus and intensity, not hurrying and easy ways out. Tenacious application is required, what Da Vinci called “ostinato rigore” 

Grandiosity: praise does harm. We will start working to attract praise and as our ego inflates we’ll come to believe it’s our natural brilliance that pushed us up. What must motivate you is the process and the work itself. 

Inflexibility: it’s about paradoxes and holding two thoughts at once. For examples doubts about what you know and trusting yourself
