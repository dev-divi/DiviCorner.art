Writing this just made me realize that in a way, I've been meditating on death directly, and inside it is wonderous excitement, and power, and charisma and charm, right next to my natural fear of not being, but in this meditation, "I have never been born and I have never died". There is nothing to die or be born, it's just me. It's apart from my character and identity, like a pause of silence, 
And I'm inside that pause. 
And I can look around and see the present far easier, 
And my own thought traffic is clear too. I don't have to try to stop the automatic patterns of my mind imagining problems in the future, or daydreaming about memories, not with this focus. 

As I remain in this meditation with open eyes as move about the city and people in it, and consider beauty, in beautiful decay, 
Even in this city swarming with cars and traffic and giant ugly towers, under it all I can still see the loving heart of man
