Thinking again that  
"Is it not odd that anything exists?",  
 it is odd that everything exists. 
 
Everything ever conceived is here,   
all of the worst and best imaginations of humanity are all here,   
all of the ends of times and all of the beginning of times    
and all of the hopes and dreams and all of the good and evil    
and all of the types and possibilities  

if it is possible  
it becomes real
