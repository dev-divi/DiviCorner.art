Divine Bliss Subject Amiss     
Caught Fish Damsel's Kiss     
Floating Dark Burns     
Changing my Concerns     
Higher Intentions, Sought and      
They Will Be Found      
You Will Not Want      
My Soul Abounds     
Stretching out a cross a sea      
radiance passes over me      
androids dreaming of electric sheep      
and for life my soul to keep      
Somewhere near my lifelong June      
Somewhere near my resurrection      
we are full of introspection      
For my heart Your Soul Abounds     
Listening When and Listening Where      
Moment is Shared my Heroism Dared to      
Defy You Become Blue      
Or Shades of Hue      

What Else Pours Out a Cup of Grace      
Leaves my Heart without a Trace     
Forgotten Before They Reached The Shore     
Left there Staring Forevermore      
Was there beauty in the Sky      
Something deeper I once cried      

The Living Song to near to hear      
So why do I keep cataloguing,      
Fear?      

Moments Lost for Time gained,      
no closer to infinite fame,      
Passions pursued passions surround,      
wrapped in letters around my town,      
have you met the villagers today?      
most are quite friendly, sort of, hey      

And perhaps I collect what is beautiful to cover myself up,      
I the sand,      
and you the seashell,     
and the wave gently brushing           
you back over     
in that rhythm      
that same song.
