 from Proverbs 2 

My son, if you accept my words

and hide my commandments within you,

if you incline your ear to wisdom

and direct your heart to understanding,

if you truly call out to insight

and lift your voice to understanding,

if you seek it like silver

and search it out like hidden treasure,

then you will discern the fear of the LORD

and discover the knowledge of God.

Blessed is the man who finds wisdom,

the man who acquires understanding,

for she is more profitable than silver,

and her gain is better than fine gold.

She is more precious than rubies;

nothing you desire compares with her.

Long life is in her right hand;

in her left hand are riches and honor.

All her ways are pleasant,

and all her paths are peaceful.

She is a tree of life to those who embrace her,

and those who lay hold of her are blessed.

# 
`Then he taught me, and he said to me,
    “Take hold of my words with all your heart;
    keep my commands, and you will live.
Get wisdom, get understanding;
    do not forget my words or turn away from them.
Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you;
    love her, and she will watch over you.
**The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. ************
    Though it cost all you have, get understanding.**
Cherish her, and she will exalt you;
    embrace her, and she will honor you.
She will give you a garland to grace your head
    and present you with a glorious crown.”
`

Ironic then how we are in the age of knowledge and yet wisdom is dwindling.

The age of man's knowledge and wisdom is dwindling.

`My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee,`  
`lean not on your own understanding;`  
`you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.`   
`For the written text brings death, but the Spirit gives life.`  

Man suffers for relying on his mind's knowledge and limited understanding. 
Wisdom is a higher understanding. 

We are in the age of the tree of man's mind's lower knowledge, and 
as wisdom dwindles out, we are getting devastated.
