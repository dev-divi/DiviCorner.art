Expanding on the concepts brought up in the previous post, there exists Love, a living alchemical force that is intelligent and reactive, like the way chemicals interact. I'm explaining that this force has transformative properties and alters the construction of what it comes in contact with, it can turn something into what it is, no matter what it is. 


FMA's familiar fictional principle can be used to explain this concept of an interdimensional love.  
The Law of Equivalent Exchange states, " 
Were there a "Law of Equivalent Exchange", it is possible for that principle to be broken, 
because love exists in a different dimension and doesn't operate by the laws of this space. 

If it is impossible to add mass to our universe, it is not impossible to add love. 
Hard to believe, but it is actually that energy from a different dimension can be channeled into this world 
and cause changes that break the normal laws of this plane, because that dimension supercedes this one, 
its laws are the definitive principles and can break the laws of a lower plane.

Why this is so important is because all things here, including energy here is limited.
As we've just discussed in the last writing, happiness is so limited that we literally have to fight others to hold onto a limited amount of it, which we only do if our reserves are at a starvation level.

The access to channeling energy from outside this limited space means that it is possible to generate unlimited spiritual energy, there is no limit. There is not even a limit to the amount that we can contain, as even if our bodies can only store so much, it can still overflow outside of us. rather than limited energy that drains, it is possible to have infinite energy that does not have to be managed and spent cost effectively here or there on a budget. 

The following paragraph in italics may be confusing for most readers and is not necessary to read, but is here for a secondary explanation of the content in this writing.  
*"**The All** [Infinite living mind, Spirit, as compared to finite "Life and Mind"] cannot be Matter, for nothing rises higher than its own source--nothing is ever manifested in an effect that is not in the cause",*
The authors go on to state, *"For the purposes of thought and understanding, we are justified in thinking of Spirit as Infinite Living Mind, at the same time acknowledging that **we cannot fully understand it. We must either do this or stop thinking of the matter at all.**"* 

This following paragraph may be extremely confusing for most readers and is not necessary to read.  
*"Let us see! On his own plane of being, how does Man create? Well, first, he may create by making something out of outside materials. But this will not do, for there are no materials outside of **The All** with which it may create. Well, then, secondly, Man pro-creates or reproduces his kind by the process of begetting[ sex ], which is self-multiplication accomplished by transferring a portion of his substance to his offspring. But this will not do, because THE ALL cannot transfer or subtract a portion of itself, nor can it reproduce or multiply itself--in the first place there would be a taking away, and in the second case a multiplication or addition to **The All**, both thoughts being an absurdity. Is there no third way in which **Man** creates? Yes, there is--he **creates mentally**! And in so doing he uses no outside materials, nor does he reproduce himself, and yet his Spirit pervades the Mental Creation."*
