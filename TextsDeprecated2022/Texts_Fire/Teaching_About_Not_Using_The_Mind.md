About not using the mind, 

Accessing meaning doesn't require comprehension or figuring it out or thinking about it, 
thinking about it is the problem 

Trying to figure it out is the problem 

Accessing the meaning is attained only by the art of listening

You ask for the meaning and you wait on the meaning to be revealed to you. 

[Psychology describes working with the subconscious in the same way.] 

"I'm one to want explicit answers, it's always fun to experience a revealing moment though, I prefer qualitative works" 

You've grown up in a culture that values measuring data and when the data is measured enough it satisfies
School taught you this

Deeper knowing is more knowing than surface knowing

Knowing in itself is more knowing than observational knowing

Knowing that a tree is there is even more than seeing that the tree is there

One of the two could be an illusion

And it is the latter

'Explicit' means convincing enough at this very second

This is dependent on the facts to remain concrete like our ability to stand without falling through the earth

However the faith in that concreteness of a physical world is misplaced, 
it is the physical that dies and disappears and erodes
