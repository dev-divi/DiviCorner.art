subcategory how to learn 

to me your solution is in studying methods of reading comprehension
[12:00 PM] The Great Divenie.comðŸ§žâœ¨: see what im doing here, 
I know that someone has already been through this problem and they have solved it, 
so instead of trying to figure out the problem, look at it directly, and target that 

I have book A: 
Now let me ask some questions 
1. Does the Author start with a direct, clear, identifiable solution? 
2. Does the author have a solution? 
3. Does the author sound confused? 
4. Does the author write in an unclear way? An unnecessarily technical way? 
5. Who is the author? What is around his world? What kind of people are around him? Is he caught up surrounded by idiots in the maze of big business? Is he a guy who lives alone in a temple with a clear head? 
6. What kinds of people read this author? Do I like those people? Do I want to be like those people? 

My advice, if the answer to the question is not on the cover of the book, 
the author does not give an answer. 
If there is not an immediately accessible chapter that explains how to use the method practically today, 
the book is worthless, discussing how you ought to live, but not providing the means to do so. 

If this is not enough, analyze the writer. Does he want to be worshipped? Does he care about you? Does he want to be right? Does he think he's intelligent? Is he putting down others? 

Stay away from authors that want to feel intelligent, their intention is not primarily to help you
