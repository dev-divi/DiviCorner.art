It came to my attention last night that I don't actually have a 
definitive writing on creative energy generating techniques I use 

# Vortexing 

![Insert Vera Image Quote, You Are The Storm.]()

I practice energy vortexing sometimes

Agon: 
"1. What does actively spiraling the energy feel like?
2. How does one do this?
3. What does the aftermath of this feel like?
4. how does this help you?"
" 
It feels chaotic and probably exactly like what you imagine, 

I think I just center myself and imagine trying to move the energy "around me", outside my body, 
which is dependent on the question, "is there energy around me to be moved" 
and so this would be more effective if I was say, angry or had emotions available to move like this. 

The aftermath feels like power, especially power over myself, I also have more energy physically, I have the power of controlling that emotion rather than that emotion controlling me, 

I have additional space outside of my body as I extend into the room or out unto the earth 

How does this help me, moving energy processes quicker in my opinion, it doesn't get stuck, it's easier to work with. 

It might not be a good practice. Someone mentioned that they did it once so I just started working on it myself from that point forward. 

Biggest + is I can do it when no one knows I'm doing it, at any time 

The aftermath feels to me like I am a  firestorm 
But then of course I must be very careful to not use a powerfully charged tongue and the words that might slip out of it


I would focus on channeling that excess energy from vortexing into the ground, the mother earth, or metal, something conductive, 
lightning rod status

 Agon: "So by turning emotions into an abstract manifestation of "energy" that can be pushed outside of ones body, and mentally/physically moved around, one can feel a sense of power and process emotion faster. Turning emotion into a "flow" of sorts that can be shifted and guided, rather than a static state makes a lot of sense to me"
