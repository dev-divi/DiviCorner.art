Part 1: 80/20 

Part: Deconstruction 

I was also taught information filtering and analysis techniques but i don't know how to share that directly, 

Basically deconstruct any writing you see, asking, "What is the authors intention here?" 
"Is the author biased?" 
"Why are they biased?" 
"What is their main point?" 
"What are they trying to do?"

Part 2: Sources 

On filtering information, 

for me at this point, if it has been published within the last 100 years or so, 
or especially the last 20 years, 
it probably isn't the best source of the information. 

I just saw the Dalai Lama had an entire wall of books at the bookstore, probably 100 books. 
I won't be reading that. 

Why? Because I ask, is anyone reading the works of the 13th Dalai Lama? 
What about the 12th? 
The 11th? 

I'm sure the Dalai Lama is a great guy but you know who will be remembered centuries from now? 
Not the Dalai Lama, 

Buddha. Buddha will still be remembered. 

You have to realize that most of the noteworthy happenings of today are going to disappear.

I will be focused much more on teaching on this topic in the future.
