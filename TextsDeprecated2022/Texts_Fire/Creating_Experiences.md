I'm just saying that I do factually know how to create experiences to connect with any feeling or thing in this universe, 

that you can create any experience

[10:23 AM] The Great Divenie.comðŸ§žâœ¨: When I touch a pink japanese tree,

[10:24 AM] The Great Divenie.comðŸ§žâœ¨: If you already know what the feeling is then you know where it is
