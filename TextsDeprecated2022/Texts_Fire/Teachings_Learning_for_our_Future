Maybe I should Just Log the Entire Conversation and make it available 

Because I believe that the reason we think we are learning and doing things is not the reason we are doing them.
[9:03 PM] Jamie: truuue
[9:03 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: I believe that we are learning things now so that we can do things that we don't know about yet later.
[9:03 PM] Jamie: i can see that
[9:05 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: This means that man's limited lower understanding is this idea of what I'd like to do with what I'm learning, 

I want to go over here and catalogue a bunch of resources, 
you know, that's pretty cool, but it's not like, amazing, incredible, it's limited, like the limited mind that has thought about wanting to do it
[9:06 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: So I believe this limited mind doesn't actually need to understand or know exactly what to do, from right now we just need to make sure we're growing and learning as much as we can handle and trust it works out
[9:07 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: and I'm now at a position where like I'm saying, there's no way I could have picked up NextJs in a few days without this prior experience in Jekyll. 
But Jekyll is a very niche and closed off little box. There's no way I could have anticipated the usefulness of that system in another application later.
[9:07 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: there are also things i didn't learn, that would have saved me struggle today had I just explored them back then
[9:07 PM] Jamie: okay yeah i understand that
[9:08 PM] Jamie: i mean accumulating knowledge on anything always opens up doors to learn more about other things
[9:08 PM] Jamie: even if not completely related
[9:08 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: it's true
[9:09 PM] acc: Niche?
[9:09 PM] acc: Jekyll has been a big deal for like a decade
[9:09 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: looked at it graphically though you open doorways / pathways with the doors you open 

I do think it's a bit more than just similarity, because there are conceptual levels of understanding that allow us to venture into certain fields 
I do know there are things waiting for us in the future 

but my main advice now on learning is avoid thinking, 
"oh that's not me. I don't have time to do that." 
if it's within the realm of skillful creative things [music dance song art] it is likely a skill useful to you later and it is in fact you. 
It doesn't mean you have to be a renaissance man 
or that you have to devote 40 hours a week to it but 
if you see something coming up that your intuition considers investigating, don't shoot it down because "it's not you"

Jamie: 
you know whats also true. The more you learn skills. The better you get at learning other skills, and the more familiar you are with the process of learning skills
[9:20 PM] Jamie: you start to become familiar with the idea of repetition to build skills
[9:20 PM] Jamie: and that there is corresponding theory to learn for the physical aspects of a skill

 The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: You are not only becoming more flexible because of a mastery of the process, 

now you're actually changing your identity to become a someone who is familiar with the process of learning skills, someone who is comfortable and familiar with the idea and habits of repetition to build skills,
[9:24 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: and you know that there is a corresponding theory, in other words, 
you know that it can be done

You learn that things are possible and not impossible. 
You become a person in which things are possible for
[9:24 PM] acc: I'm too much of an autist to view it on a human level
[9:24 PM] acc: I see what Jamie just explained similarly, but building your personal framework
[9:24 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: I mention identity because before the identity was limiting, "I am not the person who knows how to learn skills" 
it's a problem of identity
[9:26 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: the identity changes to a person who has these repetitive habits and learns these theories, a framework about who they are and what they can do is affected by it. 
The idea of which limitations they have and which things are "for them" changes
[9:26 PM] Jamie: its actually shocking how many people think its an impossible thing to learn a skill such as a musical instrument

People tend to view things too much at the end skill level
[9:27 PM] acc: and can't fill the gaps between that they have to work step by step
[9:27 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: On the converse, people are quick to be critics because they refuse to look at the effort that goes into creation, 

in their mind a musician "just makes music"
[9:28 PM] acc: I don't think anything taught this more for me than abandoning Windows
[9:28 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: my mother for example has a conception that I just do computer things 
there is no conception of which things would require enormous effort and which things would take no effort
[9:29 PM] Jamie: its kinda funny, EDM producers use to get a lot of flack for "just hitting buttons". But like any other skills, theres a crazy amount of skill and knowledge involved in producing music electronically
[9:29 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: the talent is channeled into the hard work, 
but its not the talent that makes it real
[9:29 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: no kidding
[9:29 PM] Jamie: just because it isnt a tangible physical instrument/skill, people are suddenly not able to comprehend the ability involved 
[9:31 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: it's because of how people think of themselves first when they aren't being conscious 
They don't know how to do that thing, 
so they have painted a mental image of what that thing is
[9:31 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: they identify that 'EDM producers make EDM music '
[9:31 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: and they arent an edm producer
[9:31 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: but if they were
[9:31 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: they know how good they'd be
[9:32 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: if I made that movie, I know how I'd make it so much better than this guy
[9:32 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: we've gotten used to this as a culture, myself included
[9:36 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: it's a pretty deep subject though because in terms of skill and quality in these art forms we aren't talking about how 'great the thing is'
the skill we admire is how successfully we were able to bring concept/thought/form into reality.

The best creations seem to be straight from the imagination brought into perfect form. 
Normally we have things that looked good in concept but we were unable to bring the vision into form, 

which is not a skill you can learn, and it isn't a matter of money either, you can have lots of skill and still fail to create a product that lives up to the imagination, the unformed thought .
[9:37 PM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: ghost in the shell live action to me is a great example of this, an impressive piece of work. 
people hated it :tearykek:
