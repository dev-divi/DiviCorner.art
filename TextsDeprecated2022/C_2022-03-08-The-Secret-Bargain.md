One day I'm going along and on this day, it's just too much. 

I can't do this anymore. I can't live this way anymore. I'm stuck in a loop in my own life, and I'm trapped, and I can't get out. I can't be this person anymore. I can't handle feeling this way anymore. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to get out, but I have to get out. I cannot feel this these feelings anymore. I'm not who I'm supposed to be, I can't keep up with the pressure of the outside world, I can't handle not being good enough, I can't handle all of these thoughts torturing me, my thoughts waiting for me when I close my eyes at night. 

Something is wrong with me. Something is wrong with me. I need someone to help me, anyone to help me. I have to go to the doctor. I have to make a doctor's appointment. 

So now I'm at the doctor and he's looking at me quizically, and he asks me what's wrong, and I tell him, 
"I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't why I am this way. I need you to help me. This problem is too big, it's getting in the way of my life, and I got a life to deal with, I don't have the time for this." 

And so he asks me what he thinks the problem is, and I tell him, "Doctor, if I knew what the problem was, I wouldn't be here. That's your job, you fix problems, are you not good at your job?" 

How do I tell him that I can't feel this way anymore? This feeling is overwhelming me. I just need it to be fixed. 

And here is where we start to make a bargain. You see, on a human level, I'm looking the doctor, and my eyes, they're saying to him, "I need support here, human to human, please help me. I got these feelings, and it's too much. I need to be okay." The doctor's eyes are human too, he knows, he knows I'm suffering here and I'm asking for a solution, 
and this is where our slightly dishonest pact begins to form. 

I know that what I am really asking for is to feel different that I'm feeling now. But I can't let myself know that. I can't be thinking like that. Because I don't know what the problem is. Because the doctor is the one who identifies the problem, not me. The problem has to be something else. The problem can't be unsolvable. I have a life to live, I have a problem and I have chosen to fix it because that's what I do, I fix my problems. 

And the doctor says to me, "Well son, yes I can see that there is a problem, let's see if we can figure out what's going on with you. I have some lists of problems here, so we'll go through the list and I'll ask you some questions and we'll find out what you're suffering from." 

This is perfect for me. This is our secret bargain. Finally, someone will make my problem go away, he will find out what it is and I won't have to worry about it anymore. I won't have to think about this anymore. I can get my life back on track. These overwhelming feelings won't have the last laugh, I will, because I have to, because I have a life to live. 

Whatever it takes Doc, whatever it takes. 

And so the doctor comes to me with a remedy, and finally I have some comfort. I finally know, what's wrong with me. It's this disorder, a super rare disorder in fact, only very special people have it, which means I have unique problems that I have to deal with that other people don't, because other people could not understand what I am suffering from. My suffering is special. 

And now I have the remedy, the outside support, the knowing what's wrong with me, the  comfort of structure of the remedy being available in a few weeks with my subscription, the security of my healer checking up on me to make sure that I'm still alright. In our bargain, I have received everything I asked for. My every wish has been fulfilled.
