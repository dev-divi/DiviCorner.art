I'll just answer now. Yes I am awakened but this is the wrong question. This question is important, but the question you ought to be asking is *how awakened* am I. 

And by the way, part of what allows me to know I am awakened is that I have made eye contact with awakened people and their eyes recognized me as awakened, and my eyes recognized theirs, and I knew. 
And in conscious thought, I told her in a few words, that I was seeing her and how amazing she was, and she reflected back to me, "Takes one to know one, James." This particular moment was actually just a few weeks ago and I actually have the YouTube video. 

As for how awakened am I, this is the wrong model, it doesn't describe how I experience what this is. Awakening for me is essentially self actualization, self recognition. Now here is why it's so difficult. 
I don't become more or less awakened.  There IS an awakened Self, and I know His voice. His voice is my voice, and I am him. I have always been Him. 
But I am not near him always. 
I have for most of the time been little ol' me. As I position myself, and as many things happen, as I come into balance and alignment with all things, 

The gates line up, and light can shine down through the gates, and I can look up and access my voice. 

When you ask am I awakened, you ask, " is my awareness currently positioned in a direction from which I have a view to bear witness to my awakening." and more importantly, you ask, "am I experiencing that now". 

When I am speaking to you from my breath, when my words are coming from a place that is deeper, when my words are not echoes of a thought that is not my own reverberating through the machine, when I am here and present, the awakened one is here with me also, and the unawakened one is here with me also, but he has chosen to become quiet. 

You want to know if you are awakened, 
do you know what Eternal Life is? Are you experiencing eternal life? Have you experienced perfection? Have you experienced wholeness? Have you experienced healing? Have you experienced peace? Have you experienced the Holy Spirit? Have you experienced god in man and man in god? Have you experienced light? Have you experienced the universe? Have you seen beyond your thoughts? Have you seen thought itself? Have your ears been opened to see the invisible world? Do you know who you are? Have you experienced presence in which your experience is immeasurably precious and sacred to hold, that This is abundantly beyond everything you have ever desired and wanted? Have you connected to all of humans? Have you understood in your soul that we are one being? Have you found who you were looking for? Have you seen what cannot be lost? Have you seen that what you are and care about cannot die? Have you recognized this as all there is in eternity?
Can you see that even within these questions only describes experiences that you may or may not remember having? Can you see that these experiences have happened and faded from your memory or may be in your future? Can you see that you have always been here? 

Can you find see silence within noise and beautiful chaos? Can you find the love within destruction? Do you see that all things are and have always been? Do you see that all that you are has always been? Can you see that all things are always beginning and always ending? 

Do you need to establish man as an awakened? I think you do not. I think you have been scammed. You have been scammed with believing that man rises from a state of imperfection to a state of only perfection. 
You want perfect operation, and this may be possible, but you don't want a man who is not perfect. You believe in a perfect man because you have been entertained with fantasies of him and depictions of him in your world even when you know this is not real. All evidence tells you that no human is perfect, but some people choose to express perfection. And that is what we desire. 
Understand now that a perfect human would be incomplete. 
We are all. From awareness and awakening you are all. 
Awakening does not mean you have risen to be in one state of heightened perfection. It means you have risen to be in an awareness of all. 
The awakened one is aware of his perfection and his imperfection, he sees that all things are in the world and he sees that all of himself is within himself. He is victim, predator, savior, rebel, saved, guilty, redeemed, indifferent, connected, healed, suffering, he is all things as his world is all things, 
And the one experiencing him IS love. 
And the awakened one knows that they are love.
