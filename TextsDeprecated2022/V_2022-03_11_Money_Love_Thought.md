[ These statements are specially crafted, 
they highlight key beliefs that a person needs to work on changing in themselves, 
and prophecies, namely in the last three paragraphs that such changes will occur.
Some statements also require active participation from the reader, the reader should visualize and even allow themselves to feel what is spoken within the words as it is. 

These statements have been cultivated from a larger direct stream of consciousness writing, unplanned and channeled out directly. 

My own affirmations would not be usually shared, 
it is in the power of the last two paragraphs that convinced me to share a portion of this.

I felt I could not reduce these statements more than I have. 

There are techniques utilized in these words that if you have an eye to see them, you can re-use them.
Some of these sentences mean something different and are received differently to our inner processor than it means to our conscious thinker. 

(I did not use my thinking mind to intentionally use any technique, it appears my mind now understands how to use them on its own.)

If a particular statement calls out to you, repeat it 3 times, write it down, perhaps in your own words, and leave the written statement nearby where you will inevitably run into it for a few days. Do not share what you have faith in with others around you.
