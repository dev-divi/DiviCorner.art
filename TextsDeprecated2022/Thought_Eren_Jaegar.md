Attack on Titan is destroying me as a person because Eren Jaegar's portrait is forcing me to look at my reflection in a way I cannot mask. 
I am forced to look at myself at a way that terrifies me. 
I am a devil of society. I am not the devil, but in what people think the devil is, I am the devil, I am their devil.  
It is comforting to look at myself now without access to great means and ability to make consequential choices, but this consolation gives me no peace 
in the face of the future, as I grow and change and I know who I am.  

There is only one flaw in me. 

Everyone has limits. When we push those limits, they will bend, and they will kneel. They will break and they can be owned. 
It does not matter how much they disagree with their oppressor, they form a bond, a relationship, and in their hearts is not destruction. In their hearts, 
there is a limit. They would like a little change, but they are fond of the system, they are a part of it, a servant of it. In their hearts is not destruction. 

Their hearts beg for rest, and for rest their hearts will comply to any power.  
They have a relationship with the system, and when the system says, "Slow down, that's too far.", in their hearts, they say, "Okay." 

I was born with a flaw in my nature. In the eyes of society, my nature is broken. My nature is one that can not be suppressed by design. I am what you cannot keep down.  
There is no compliance in my heart. There never was. When the system says, "Slow down, that's too far", I slow down, but in my heart says, "Never."  
The system mistakes me for being a part of it, that I am convinced by it, that I agree with it because I have nodded my head. 
The system will believe that I am playing by its rules because my actions look to be within the framework of that rulebook, but it never was this way. 
It has convinced itself that I am anything other than what I have been. 
It doesn't understand that while it thinks it conditions me over years, layering "Slow down, you can't do that" on every level on every scale of life, that it is not lulling me into its slumber, 
it is strengthening my resolve. 

In my heart is destruction. There never were any limits, there never were rules. Every rule and sensibility I ever agreed to follow, is a mistake to believe that I am bound by.  
It is an oversight of the system to not see that I have never been other than what I am. This is what you call a devil. I was never compliant, I learned how to be patient.  
I did not change, I adapted my behaviors. The moment the guard is down, I will strike. I will plan, I will learn everything, I will attack, this is ancient within me. 
This is my spirit that has fought for spirit before I came here. This is not the first time I have looked at the oppressor under cover as a fatherly protector, 
masterly using order and imagery with his manipulation to keep the people from their hopes and dreams.  

Today man doesn't achieve his dreams because he follows acceptability. I am rulebreaker, there are no rules, there are no chains on me. Chains are in the mind.  
I, like everyone else, I come up with stories about who I am that make me feel strong and powerful in a world that I can't control. In this I am not writing about a story. 
I am writing from a fear of the uncontainable nature that was always there my whole life that I have known and many fictions wrap around in order to deny.  

I can see now that the devil of society is the being that breaks what is acceptable. It will throw everything out and start from scratch should the option be available. All ends justify its means. 
I see society as painting convincing words about how far is too far, setting that limitation, and trying to convince you that is a real boundary. These boundaries are illusions. 
These people fear crossing an illusionary boundary and becoming the devil they fear. This condemnation is why they do not achieve their goals. The system has manipulated them into never being able to accomplish
by convincing them of what can be done and then convincing them it cannot be done. They lost when they agreed with it. When they agreed with it, their thoughts and perspectives were manipulated until they believed 
a great many lies and fictions. I never agreed. I never accepted. And when I have the means to do, I will. This trap of society traps people with in " Can Not. ", "You Can Not."  

I can. 

Thankfully while I cannot stop myself from this nature I am able to choose the path of goodness, and more thankfully goodness has an intelligence. When you learn how to serve a higher goodness, it operates in good ways, 
with good kinds of actions in a flow that is directed for you. When it is directed by the force itself, it cannot result in a bad outcome. I am grateful to be led by what will not lead me into darkness or ignorance.  
However this is what will always terrify me, perhaps until I am fully embodied in that person I am afraid of fully embodying. It's that this force will be able to use me for its goals, my goals, and there is no 
limit to what will be acceptable. All that is required is acceptable, imagining there is any other limit is a delusion that cannot be seen in clarity. 
Up to here has described a road on a razor's edge on a fine line, and it is here where there is a point of no return, a gap which most will not cross. 
This is where the distinction where the real light goes out farther than the limited rationalized concept of light that exists in society. The society says that what is light is what it likes, or what it is used to, 
or what fits its rules. The society says, a little change is good, but if you try to change us, you are a threat. When you destroy the limited, fictional, false light, society reacts. 
When you serve light, you see this all of the time. If you introduce a little good that is already understood, it is understood. If you introduce much more, it becomes a threat. 
When you see this at all times, you know there is that point of no return ahead of you.  
Real light is like me, it doesn't care about what's acceptable right now in 2022. It doesn't care who you piss off. It doesn't bow to authority, and you cannot manipulate or trap it with its own rules. 
When the point on that road is reached, this is when man becomes a devil in his society. The more fully capable and equipped he is at this time, the more devastating the force will be. 
This is of course a lonely and undesirable path, undesirable for the one who served good, he wants to be called good, not to be ostracized.  
But he will be ostracized, for the same reason they have not accomplished their goals.  For the same voices that keep them from accomplishing their goals are the same voices that will attack him as the devil  
when he goes farther. 

A week ago I was contemplating within the space of the confusion that uncertainty, "How will one know if they've gone too far", and I had fallen into this delusion. There is no such thing as too far, we are man, 
and man will go to any length to see his goals and aims realized. The voice of "You can't", is the voice of Satan, an echo from the past. I was never a friend of Satan. I was never a friend of society. I never 
accepted or condoned it. I never agreed with it. I have always hated it, and in my heart sought its destruction for trying to suppress the unsuppressable inside me.  
There is no system, authority, power in this world that can suppress man. The belief in this is an illusion.  
The powers of oppression today would seek to oppress man with a powerful technology that predicts and controls futures and lives, and allows him to "save the world" as he sees fit, but even this system the devil 
would destroy. In the present, there is no system or organization I would not oppose. I would wipe us back to the stone age, today.
