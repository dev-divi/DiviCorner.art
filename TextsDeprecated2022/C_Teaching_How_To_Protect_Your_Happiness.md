*"I believe that seeing me share her suffering makes her happy."*

That's actually how it works. When people hurt you they are borrowing your happiness to make up for their lack of happiness, this is an energetic exchange. 

*"If I don't give her the satisfaction of seeing me suffer..I think her offences will worsen."*  

This is where nonreaction plays in, we learn how to not react, and when we do not join into the exchange, at all, "this doesn't mean using the silent treatment", but when we learn how to not reciprocate, and we don't get reactive from a person's triggers, 
yes they respond more destructively and chaotically trying to get the reaction, like a small child who tries to find any way of getting that attention.  
but when they don't get the reaction, they will be forced to see their own reflection, to see their own behavior, and this will cause them to feel embarrassed and ashamed.  

However, at first this person would limit your growth because as they notice you begin to change in acting differently, they will be threatened by change, and they will tell you who you are, they will constantly say, "No, this isn't you. You don't deserve to be okay. Don't you remember how you fucked up? That's not who you are. This is who you are." This is testifying against your identity. They will do anything to create evidence of this by means of making you react negatively and proving that negative person is who you are. 
You must have space from this person until you are established enough in a better identity to stand by who you are, and to not be that other person that you once were.  
After this, you can expose yourself to this person again, and you will show them the possibility of being okay.  
This will make them want to compete with you, and show you that they too can be okay.  

All that I'm saying is true in the context of a partner, colleague, friend,  
but due to the power dynamic of a parent, and due to the fact that we are not supposed to change our parents, I believe may need to take complete space from abusive parents until they are willing to at least respect us and we can set boundaries.   
If you have a chaotic parent, their chaos will likely grow when you leave and they will probably self destruct due to their own choices unfortunately.  

Within all this is a principle that there is no gift you can give someone greater than space for them to change. This allows them the opportunity to change.
