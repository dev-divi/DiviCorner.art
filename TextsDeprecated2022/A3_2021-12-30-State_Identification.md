True: ""How are you supposed to identify as being in a certain state? How are you supposed to know when you are in a certain state?" 

With states in general, this identification is hard. 
There are 'dead', 'copy' mental states that can seem much like spiritual states, 
but there are identifiers that you can immediately identify, 
identifying what kinds of thoughts are you connected to, 
what kinds of feelings are you connected to, 
how expanded is your awareness of the world vs. a limited storybook storyline, 
how HD / 4K is the world, 
are you thinking new thoughts or are you reciting old thoughts in an old pattern? 
Are you existing right now, are your thoughts new? 

Our biggest blindness is ourselves, so identifying states is one of the most helpful and difficult skills we can attain. 
In general what affects what state you end up in the most is what you have been focused on. 

The main variables you may notice are, "Dead" and "New". States of reality are full of newness. 
States of illusion are full of repetition and what was, even what was true before. 
You can have the same thoughts you once did, but now have them with no meaning and no perspective. 

In terms of expansion and contraction, it is much easier to tell the difference between these, 
expansive states are usually when you feel good,  when you want to connect with others, 
the contraction state is when you shrink inward, withdraw away, sometimes enter a more negative state, 
hold an awareness of self and insecurities and weaknesses, this is the time for rest, 

Unfortunately for most thinking males, we tend to already spend a lot of time in a contracted state, 
living withdrawn, living passively and not actively, so we are already low, and then when we contract we go really really low. 

More activity helps to balance this out, which likely means consuming less information. Less information overload. Actually less books, more relation to the world. 


Anonymous: _"For a month, for the first time in years, my mental health has definitely taken a down turn. Compounded by life throwing shade at me.
Sitting here and considering the State that I’m in is an interesting thing. 
I can actively see that I’m going through what you just described; 
My usual state is pretty low, I don’t make life my bitch. 
But now I’m even worse off. I’m in that contraction state that you just described._

_Thanks for the introspection."_ 

I believe we are far closer to being able to make great change in the contraction state than in the expansive states. 
Even though expansive is what is more enjoyable, contraction is far more lucrative, at the cost of undesirable and painful.. 

It does not make much sense but it is possible that the lowest state is right next to god, 
Not to mention, the silence, in between us and the voices of demons, 
is the same silence that would bring us peace were we to become still in it. 

It is not unlike the idea that Geralt explains to Ciri that she must face her fears, 
that the only way forward is in facing the undesirable feeling, sitting with it instead of trying to get away from it.
