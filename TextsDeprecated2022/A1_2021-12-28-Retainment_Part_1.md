What information changes us? Are you retaining the information you receive each day? 
There is certain information that may influence us if it causes us to alter our focus and direction.
It matters which information you are honing in on, but most knowledge is worthless and not worth retaining, 
there are a lot of true observations on certain levels that do not end up mattering in understanding life or in practical use. 

If you are consuming tons of information, it is hard to say if any of it is sticking. 
In defense of some level of change, 
"I cannot remember the books I have read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.‚Äù 

When it gets down to most information though, a bigger question comes into view, and that is, 
'which part of my being am I feeding information in an attempt to grow, 
and how temporal - temporary - is that part of me. 
You start to see when developing that there are ways to develop that do not last, 
there are parts of mind that you outgrow and never go back to. 

Meanwhile there are other parts of you that you can come in contact with in a passing glance, 
and you start to see the nature of these [parts of being] is that they do not grow in the same way, 
they do not need to take in information, they already have knowing, and they know a great deal more than 'you'. 
One of these parts is the "authentic, real you", which I have glimpsed a few times in my life, 
That person is clearly more advanced than I and has depths and personality that I lack. 
There is also Wisdom as a voice that has Wisdom, and in this way it does not seem to grow or gain, it seems to just be there, 
perhaps grounded in reality. 
 
With this discretion between temporal and temporary is a deeper interpretation of a verse I have shared before, 
_"But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal."_

The base interpretation of this verse was simply, "Physical, earthly things fade and are temporary, 
but what is within you is of an eternal nature and can be added upon." [other of my writings explain this interpretation]

But one additional deeper insight is this,
There are parts of your soul and within you, barns and sheds that you can store up crop in, 
and when the fire comes, when the robber comes, those barns will burn down, all of that experience will be lost. 

There are barns and sheds in your mind that when you leave your valuables, your thoughts, your energy, moth and rust will destroy them over time. 
One of these temporary parts for most of us is the logic or analytical mind. Most of the information you store here does not last. 
A reason this teaching is important is that the robbers will certainly come and they will burn down your storage houses. 
Time will also pass and those storage houses will fade away. 

So knowing this you have to determine what kind of soulical growth is of a permanent and not temporary nature, you have to find out what kind of crop, 
what kind of plant is fire resistant. Among these are in developing the fruits of the heart, and perhaps certain kinds of understanding. 

The following verse is,  *For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.* 
I do not know every level of depth in this verse. At this moment I can see two levels. 
The first is the obvious,* your treasure is in your heart*. 
The second might be a warning, perhaps saying that if you store your treasure say, on earth, 
now your heart is on earth, and now you have placed your heart where it can be destroyed, and where robbers can break in and steal it. 
So the implied advice would be, 

Do not store your treasures in unsecure places, or you are putting your heart in a vulnerable place where it is gonna get destroyed when life blows away those places. 
The passage is also a message about survival in terms of one's heart.
