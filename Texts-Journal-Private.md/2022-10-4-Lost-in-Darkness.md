AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: This month
[12:46 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was looking to grow a flame inside my soul
[12:47 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was looking to transmute
[12:47 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was looking to create light
[12:47 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: In my fantasy, in my imagination, in my experience
[12:48 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I was working with some occult ideas on the matter
[12:51 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: On Sundays I would access a real burning flame from being in communion with those calling for spirit and fire
[12:52 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But on weekdays I was looking to create fire by my own power, and to create light
[12:54 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I succeeded at least in finding or creating a white light inside myself, 
or at least the experience of one. 

The result felt pure and blank and white and blissful. It was enough to sit in. Not comfortably, but enough to sit in.
[12:56 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: The problem with this was that it was cold, lifeless, and it was also like a veil.
[12:56 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Like breathing cold air
[12:57 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It was calm
[12:57 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: It was still
[12:57 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Momentarily
[12:57 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: But the shimmer between whether this was the cold of darkness or the cold of light was thin and uncertain
[12:58 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: And this veil of light barely masked the darkness that was beside my peripheral vision
[1:02 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: What was right outside of my sight, 
was the sharpness of pain. 
This white light kept that pain from me like a cloak, 
And that cloak was a space in which I did not have to acknowledge the pain. 

The pain was that of lies, the thoughts vicious enough to eat me alive were they close enough
[1:03 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: The light seems to have been a sliver of truth, enough to hold on to to be a sanity, not enough to help me.
[1:05 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: There was no righteousness, no joy, no love, no peace. 

I was only actually in pain, in a torment, and I could find no comfort. No food or validation or hug or taste could bring me comfort. 
I watched my eyes become more alien.
[1:23 AM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Not much later I began to feel my soul become swallowed up in darkness. 
I believed that if I could shine light into this darkness, that I would be okay. 

But it didn't seem to help, and my torment actually grew.
