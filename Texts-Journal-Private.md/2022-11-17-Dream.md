Dream, 
In a hospital, 
Doctor looks at me condescendingly, 
"This can't be right..
Do you have a P.h.D?" 
I shake my head, 
"Would you consider yourself a person with a high ability to manipulate and influence other people?" 

I wake up shortly after
[2:21 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: My first interpretation was the obvious, she thought I my file was too textbook to be true
[2:23 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Then I thought I about the dream
It was highly lucid, 
And I realize, 
That I may not have been the person who was supposed to be there
That there may have been a case of mistaken identity
[3:20 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Walking alone is an adult male
Can be a great experience when I am in a good State of mind

But usually I hate myself and I hate people during this experience
[3:21 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I'm not quite sure how it makes sense
But right now
My worry about what other people feel about my bothersome presence, 
This worry is diminished

By my focus on the fact that my concern should be how I feel in my heart
[3:22 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: Suddenly I see again that it's true,
I was abandoning and rejecting myself
