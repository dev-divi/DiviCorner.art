I have several theories about this spirit of the human heart being related to the songs sung in Revelations for all eternity, with each interlacing with the next. 

one of these songs says "holy holy holy"
[10:43 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: I intended to find a song that said "holy holy holy", but then I decided to instead look into what this church's "sunday service" video was, and skipped ahead to 21:21, where it just started singing "holy holy holy"
[10:45 PM]The Blessed ðŸ§žâœ¨: There was a moment during worship service today in which I began to hear and sing "worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy", in a 5 note way that was not in any song I'm aware of. 
About 30 seconds later one of the musicians begins to sing that spontaneously. 

I cannot tell if that person was able to hear me, but it is more likely that they were listening to the same "frequency" I was, that is to say, we were both listening to the same channel
